A worker may cease, or refuse to carry out, work if the worker believes that carrying out the work would expose the worker, or any other person, to a serious risk to the worker's or other person's health or safety arising from an immediate or imminent exposure to a hazard.\n      2. A worker may continue to refuse to carry out the work if\u2014\n        a: the worker attempts to resolve the matter with the PCBU as soon as practicable after first refusing to do the work; and\n        b: the matter is not resolved; and\n        c: the worker believes on reasonable grounds that carrying out the work would expose the worker or any other person to a serious risk to the worker's or other person's health or safety arising from an immediate or imminent exposure to a hazard.\n      3.

A worker who ceases work under subsection (1) must, as soon as practicable, notify the PCBU that the worker has ceased work.\n      5. Subsection (1) does not authorise a worker to refuse to do work that, because of its nature, inherently or usually carries an understood risk to the worker\u2019s health and safety, unless that risk has materially increased beyond the understood risk.\n      6. To avoid doubt, nothing in this section limits or affects an employee\u2019s right to refuse to do work under any other enactment or the general law.\n      s 28A; Model Work Health and Safety Act (Aust) ss 84, 86\n    84: Health and safety representative may direct unsafe work to cease\n      1.

The health and safety representative must not give a direction under subsection (1) unless the matter is not resolved within a reasonable time after consultation about the matter with the PCBU for whom the workers are carrying out work.\n      3. Despite subsection (2), the health and safety representative may direct the worker to cease work without carrying out that consultation if the risk is so serious and immediate or imminent that it is not reasonable to consult before giving the direction.\n      4. The health and safety representative must carry out the consultation as soon as practicable after giving a direction under subsection (3).\n      5. The health and safety representative must immediately inform the PCBU of any direction given by the health and safety representative to a worker under subsection (1).\n      6. Subsection (1) does not authorise a health and safety representative to give a direction to a worker to cease work that, because of its nature, inherently or usually carries an understood risk to health and safety unless the risk has materially increased beyond the understood risk.\n      s 28A; Model Work Health and Safety Act (Aust) s 85(1), (2), (4), (5)\n    85: Training requirements relating to giving direction to cease work\nA health and safety representative must not give a direction under section 84 to cease work unless the representative has\u2014\n      a: completed training prescribed by or under regulations; or\n      b: previously completed that training when acting as a health and safety representative for another work group.\n    86: Alternative work\n      1. If a worker ceases work, the PCBU may direct the worker to carry out alternative work at the same or another workplace if that work is safe and appropriate for the worker to carry out until the worker can resume normal duties.\n      2. A worker who ceases work must remain available to carry out alternative work as directed by the PCBU under subsection (1).\n      3. For the purposes of this section, alternative work means,\u2014\n        a: for a worker who is an employee, work within the scope of the person's employment agreement:\n        b: for a worker who is not an employee, work within the scope of the worker's contract.\n      4. In addition, a worker may agree (but cannot be directed) to do other work that is safe and appropriate for the worker.\n      s 28A(6); Model Work Health and Safety Act (Aust) s 87\n    87: Regulator may assist to resolve issues relating to cessation of work\n      1. The health and safety representative, the PCBU, or the worker may ask the regulator to assist in resolving the issue relating to the cessation of work.\n      2. If the regulator agrees to assist in resolving an issue relating to the cessation of work, the regulator must provide the assistance as soon as practicable after agreeing to assist.\n  Subpart 5: Prohibition of adverse, coercive, or misleading conduct\n    88: Meaning of adverse conduct\n      1. For the purposes of this subpart, a person engages in adverse conduct if\u2014\n        a: the person\u2014\n          i: dismisses a worker who is an employee; or\n          ii: terminates a contract for services with a worker; or\n          iii: refuses or omits to employ or engage any person on work of any description that is available and for which that person is qualified; or\n          iv: refuses or omits to offer or afford to the worker the same terms of employment or engagement, conditions of work, fringe benefits, or opportunities for training, promotion, and transfer as are made available to other workers of the same or substantially similar qualifications, experience, or skills who are employed or engaged in the same or substantially similar circumstances; or\n          v: subjects the worker to any detriment, in circumstances in which other workers employed or engaged by the person on work of that description are not or would not be subjected to such detriment; or\n          vi: retires the worker, or requires or causes the worker to retire or resign or terminate a contract for services; or\n        b: the person terminates a commercial arrangement with another person; or\n        c: the person refuses or fails to enter into a commercial arrangement with another person.\n      2.

The regulator must not accept an enforceable undertaking under subsection (1) if the regulator believes that the contravention or alleged contravention would amount to an offence against section 47.\n      3. The giving of an enforceable undertaking does not constitute an admission of guilt by the person giving it in relation to the contravention or alleged contravention to which the undertaking relates.\n    124: Notice of decision and reasons for decision\n      1. The regulator must give the person seeking to make an enforceable undertaking written notice of\u2014\n        a: its decision to accept or reject the undertaking; and\n        b: the reasons for the decision.\n      2.

Proceedings commenced in the way described in subsection (1)\ufeff(a) do not require the leave of a District Court Judge or Registrar under section 21(1)\ufeff(a) of the Summary Proceedings Act 1957.\n    138: Infringement notices\n      1. The regulator may issue an infringement notice to a person if the regulator believes on reasonable grounds that the person is committing, or has committed, an infringement offence.\n      2. The regulator may deliver the infringement notice (or a copy of it) in person to the person alleged to have committed an infringement offence or send the notice by post addressed to that person's last known place of residence or business.\n      3. An infringement notice (or a copy of it) sent by post to a person under subsection (2) is to be treated as having been served on that person when it was posted.\n      4. An infringement notice must be in the prescribed form and must contain the following particulars:\n        a: such details of the alleged infringement offence as are sufficient fairly to inform a person of the time, place, and nature of the alleged offence; and\n        b: the amount of the infringement fee; and\n        c: the address of the place at which the infringement fee may be paid; and\n        d: the time within which the infringement fee must be paid; and\n        e: a summary of the provisions of section 21(10) of the Summary Proceedings Act 1957; and\n        f: a statement that the person served with the notice has a right to request a hearing; and\n        g: a statement of what will happen if the person served with the notice neither pays the infringement fee nor requests a hearing; and\n        h: any other particulars that may be prescribed.\n      5.

The regulator may revoke an infringement notice issued under section 138 before the infringement fee is paid or an order for payment of a fine is made or deemed to be made by a court under section 21 of the Summary Proceedings Act 1957.\n      2. An infringement notice is revoked by giving written notice to the person to whom it was issued that the notice is revoked.\n      s 56B(2), (3)\n    140: Payment of infringement fees\nAll infringement fees paid in respect of infringement offences must be paid into a Crown Bank Account.\n      s 56G\n  Subpart 7: Criminal proceedings\n    141: Meaning of enforcement action\nIn this subpart, unless the context otherwise requires, enforcement action means,\u2014\n      a: in relation to the regulator, the filing of a charging document under section 14 of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011 or the issuing of an infringement notice in respect of an offence under this Act:\n      b: in relation to a person other than the regulator, the filing of a charging document under section 14 of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011 in respect of an offence under this Act.\n    142: Person may notify regulator of interest in knowing of enforcement action taken by regulator\n      1. A person may notify the regulator in the manner determined by the regulator that the person has an interest in knowing whether a particular incident, situation, or set of circumstances has been, is, or is to be subject to the taking of enforcement action by the regulator.\n      2. If the regulator receives a notification under subsection (1), the regulator must\u2014\n        a: establish whether\u2014\n          i: it or any other regulator has made a decision to take any enforcement action in respect of the incident, situation, or set of circumstances; or\n          ii: any regulatory agency has made a decision to take prosecution action in respect of the same incident, situation, or set of circumstances; and\n        b: notify the person in writing of that decision, but not the reasons for the decision.\n      s 54\n    143: Prosecutions by regulator\nSubject to section 144, a prosecution for an offence under this Act may be brought only by the regulator.\n      s 54A\n    144: Private prosecutions\n      1. A person other than the regulator may file a charging document in respect of an offence under this Act if\u2014\n        a: the regulator has not taken, and does not intend to take, enforcement action against any person in respect of the same incident, situation, or set of circumstances; and\n        b: a regulatory agency has not taken, and does not intend to take, prosecution action under any other Act against any person in respect of the same incident, situation, or set of circumstances; and\n        c: any person has received notification from the regulator under section 142(2)\ufeff(b) that neither the regulator nor a regulatory agency\u2014 \n          i: has taken enforcement action or prosecution action against any person in respect of the same incident, situation, or set of circumstances; and\n          ii: intends to take any enforcement action or prosecution action.\n      2. For the purposes of subsection (1), if the regulator or a regulatory agency is unable to take enforcement action or prosecution action against any person in respect of the same incident, situation, or set of circumstances because the person is dead, the regulator or regulatory agency (as the case may be) must be treated as intending to take enforcement action or prosecution action.\n      3. Despite subsection (1)\ufeff(b), a person other than the regulator may file a charging document even though a regulatory agency has taken or intends to take prosecution action if\u2014\n        a: the person has leave of the court; and\n        b: the person has received notification from the regulator under section 142(2)\ufeff(b) that the regulator has made a decision not to take enforcement action in respect of the same incident, situation, or set of circumstances.\n      4. If a person applies for leave under subsection (3)\ufeff(a), the Registrar must refer the matter to a District Court Judge for a direction that the person proposing to commence the proceeding file formal statements, and the exhibits referred to in those statements, that form the evidence that the person proposes to call at trial, or such part of that evidence that the person considers is sufficient to justify a trial.\n      5. Section 26(2) to (5) of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011 applies to an application for leave under subsection (3)\ufeff(a) with the following modifications:\n        a: a reference to accepting a charging document for filing must be read as if it were a reference to granting leave:\n        b: in determining whether the proposed prosecution is an abuse of process in accordance with section 26(3)\ufeff(b) of that Act, the Judge must take into account\u2014\n          i: whether allowing the proposed prosecution to proceed would be consistent with the purpose of this Act; and\n          ii: whether the proposed prosecution is in the public interest.\n      s 54A(2), (3)\n    145: Continuing or repeated matters\nNothing in this Act prevents the regulator or another person from taking enforcement action in respect of an incident, situation, or set of circumstances despite enforcement action having been taken in respect of that incident, situation, or set of circumstances, if the incident, situation, or set of circumstances is continuing or repeated.\n      s 54E\n\n    # Limitation periods for prosecutions\n\n    146: Limitation period for prosecutions brought by regulator\n      1. Despite section 25 of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011, proceedings for an offence under this Act may be brought by the regulator within the latest of the following periods to occur:\n        a: within 12 months after the date on which the incident, situation, or set of circumstances to which the offence relates first became known, or ought reasonably to have become known, to the regulator:\n        b: within 6 months after the date on which a coroner completes and signs a certificate of findings under section 94 of the Coroners Act 2006 if it appears from the certificate of findings (or the proceedings of an inquiry) that an offence has been committed under this Act:\n        c: if an enforceable undertaking has been given in relation to the offence, within 6 months after\u2014\n          i: the enforceable undertaking is contravened; or\n          ii: it comes to the notice of the regulator that the enforceable undertaking has been contravened; or\n          iii: the regulator has agreed under section 128 to the withdrawal of the enforceable undertaking.\n      2. Subsection (1)\ufeff(a) is subject to section 147.\n      s 54B; Model Work Health and Safety Act (Aust) s 232\n    147: Extension of time if regulator needs longer to decide whether to bring prosecution\n      1. This section applies if the regulator considers that it will not be able to file a charging document by the end of the 12-month period specified in section 146(1)\ufeff(a).\n      2. The District Court may, on application by the regulator made before the end of the 12-month period specified in section 146(1)\ufeff(a), extend the time available for filing a charging document for a further period not exceeding 12 months from the date of expiry of the 12-month period specified in section 146(1)\ufeff(a).\n      3. The court must not grant an extension under subsection (2) unless it is satisfied that\u2014\n        a: the regulator reasonably requires longer than the 12-month period to decide whether to file a charging document; and\n        b: the reason for requiring the longer period is that the investigation of the events and issues surrounding the alleged offence is complex or time consuming; and\n        c: it is in the public interest in the circumstances that a charging document is able to be filed after the 12-month period expires; and\n        d: filing the charging document after the 12-month period expires will not unfairly prejudice the proposed defendant in defending the charge.\n      4. The court must give the following persons an opportunity to be heard:\n        a: the regulator:\n        b: the proposed defendant:\n        c: any other person who has an interest in whether or not a charging document should be filed, being a person described in section 142(1).\n      s 54D\n    148: Limitation period for private prosecutions\nDespite section 25 of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011, proceedings for an offence against this Act may be brought by a person other than the regulator within the latest of the following periods to occur:\n      a: within 2 years after the date on which the incident, situation, or set of circumstances to which the offence relates first became known, or ought reasonably to have become known, to the regulator:\n      b: within 6 months after the date on which a coroner completes and signs a certificate of findings under section 94 of the Coroners Act 2006 if it appears from the certificate of findings (or the proceedings of an inquiry) that an offence has been committed under this Act:\n      c: within 3 months after the date of expiry of any extension granted to the regulator under section 147(2):\n      d: if an enforceable undertaking has been given in relation to the offence, within 6 months after\u2014\n        i: the enforceable undertaking is contravened; or\n        ii: it comes to the notice of the regulator that the enforceable undertaking has been contravened; or\n        iii: the regulator has agreed under section 128 to the withdrawal of the enforceable undertaking.\n    149: Certain proceedings may be brought after end of limitation period if fresh evidence discovered\nDespite anything in section 146, 147, or 148, the following proceedings may be brought after the end of the applicable limitation period if fresh evidence relevant to the offence is discovered and the court is satisfied that the evidence could not reasonably have been discovered within that period:\n      a: proceedings for an offence against section 47:\n      b: proceedings for an offence against section 48 that relates to the death of a person.\n  Subpart 8: Sentencing for offences\n    150: Application of subpart\nThis subpart applies if a court convicts a person (an offender) or finds an offender guilty of an offence under this Act.\n    151: Sentencing criteria\n      1. This section applies when a court is determining how to sentence or otherwise deal with an offender convicted of an offence under section 47, 48, or 49.\n      2. The court must apply the Sentencing Act 2002 and must have particular regard to\u2014\n        a: sections 7 to 10 of that Act; and\n        b: the purpose of this Act; and\n        c: the risk of, and the potential for, illness, injury, or death that could have occurred; and\n        d: whether death, serious injury, or serious illness occurred or could reasonably have been expected to have occurred; and\n        e: the safety record of the person (including, without limitation, any warning, infringement notice, or improvement notice issued to the person or enforceable undertaking agreed to by the person) to the extent that it shows whether any aggravating factor is present; and\n        f: the degree of departure from prevailing standards in the person's sector or industry as an aggravating factor; and\n        g: the person's financial capacity or ability to pay any fine to the extent that it has the effect of increasing the amount of the fine.\n      s 51A\n    152: Order for payment of regulator's costs in bringing prosecution\n      1. On the application of the regulator, the court may order the offender to pay to the regulator a sum that it thinks just and reasonable towards the costs of the prosecution (including the costs of investigating the offending and any associated costs).\n      2. If the court makes an order under subsection (1), it must not make an order under section 4 of the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967.\n      3. If the court makes an order under subsection (1) in respect of a Crown organisation, any costs and fees awarded must be paid from the funds of that organisation.\n      s 4(5)\n    153: Adverse publicity orders\n      1. A court may make an order (an adverse publicity order) requiring an offender\u2014\n        a: to take either or both of the following actions within the period specified in the order:\n          i: to publicise, in the way specified in the order, the offence, its consequences, the penalty imposed, and any other related matter:\n          ii: to notify a specified person or specified class of persons, in the way specified in the order, of the offence, its consequences, the penalty imposed, and any other related matter; and\n        b: to give the regulator, within 7 days after the end of the period specified in the order, evidence that the action or actions have been taken by the offender in accordance with the order.\n      2. The court may make an adverse publicity order on its own initiative or on the application of the person prosecuting the offence.\n      3.

The Minister must, before making a recommendation in relation to a provision referred to in subsection (2),\u2014\n        a: have regard to the purpose of this Act set out in section 3; and\n        b: be satisfied that the extent to which any definitions are modified, or any requirements are modified, exempted, excluded, or applied (as the case may be) is not broader than is reasonably necessary to address the matters that gave rise to the proposed regulations.\n      2. The provisions are\u2014\n        a: section 12 (which relates to the application of this Act to prescribed high-risk plant):\n        b: section 17 (which defines person conducting a business or undertaking):\n        c: section 19 (which defines worker):\n        d: section 21 (which defines supply):\n        e: section 23 (which defines notifiable injury or illness):\n        f: section 24 (which defines notifiable incident):\n        g: section 37 (which relates to the duty of a PCBU who manages or controls a workplace):\n        h: section 38 (which relates to the duty of a PCBU who manages or controls fixtures, fittings, or plant at a workplace):\n        i: section 55 (which relates to the duty to preserve sites):\n        j: section 211(1)\ufeff(q) (which authorises regulations prescribing exemptions from compliance with regulations):\n        k: section 213 (which authorises regulations relating to exemptions in respect of the Armed Forces).\n\n    # Exemptions\n\n    220: Regulator may grant exemption from compliance with regulations\n      1. The regulator may exempt any person or class of persons from compliance with any provision or provisions of regulations.\n      2. The regulator must not grant an exemption under subsection (1) unless it is satisfied that\u2014\n        a: the extent of the exemption is not broader than is reasonably necessary to address the matters that gave rise to the proposed exemption; and\n        b: the exemption is not inconsistent with the purpose of this Act.\n      3. The regulator may\u2014\n        a: grant the exemption on any terms and conditions that the regulator thinks fit; and\n        b: amend or revoke an exemption; and\n        c: replace an exemption either before or when it expires.\n      4. An exemption granted under subsection (1)\u2014\n        a: takes effect from the date specified in the notice published in accordance with section 221 (which may not be earlier than the date of the notice); and\n        b: expires on the close of the day that is 5 years after the date on which it took effect, unless it is sooner replaced or revoked.\n      5. The breach of a term or condition of an exemption granted under subsection (1) is a breach of the provision to which the exemption relates (unless the terms of the exemption provide otherwise).\n    221: Status and publication of exemptions granted by regulator\n      1. An exemption under section 220 is secondary legislation (see Part 3 of the Legislation Act 2019 for publication requirements), unless it relates only to 1 or more named persons.\n      1A. If an exemption is secondary legislation, the regulator\u2019s reasons for granting the exemption (including why it is appropriate) must be published with the exemption.\n      2. If an exemption is not secondary legislation, subsections (3), (4), and (5) apply.\n      3. As soon as practicable after an exemption granted under section 220 is made, it must be\u2014\n        a: notified in the Gazette; and\n        b: published on an Internet site maintained by or on behalf of the regulator.\n      4. The regulator\u2019s reasons for granting the exemption (including why the exemption is appropriate) must be published in accordance with subsection (3)\ufeff(b) together with the exemption.\n      5. A notification in the Gazette for the purpose of subsection (3)\ufeff(a) does not have to incorporate the exemption.\n      6.       \n [repealed] \n      -- Notes --\n      The following table is small in size and has 3 columns that are grouped under the heading Legislation Act 2019 requirements for secondary legislation referred to in subsection\u00a0(1).Legislation Act 2019 requirements for secondary legislation referred to in subsection\u00a0(1)PublicationPCO must publish it on the legislation website and notify it in the GazetteLA19 s 69(1)\ufeff(c)PresentationThe Minister must present it to the House of RepresentativesLA19 s 114, Sch 1 cl\u00a032(1)\ufeff(a)DisallowanceIt may be disallowed by the House of Representatives LA19 ss 115, 116This note is not part of the Act.\n      Section 221(1): replaced, on 28\u00a0October 2021, by section 3 of the Secondary Legislation Act 2021 (2021 No\u00a07).\n      Section 221(1A): inserted, on 28\u00a0October 2021, by section 3 of the Secondary Legislation Act 2021 (2021 No\u00a07).\n      Section 221(2): replaced, on 28\u00a0October 2021, by section 3 of the Secondary Legislation Act 2021 (2021 No\u00a07).\n      Section 221(6): repealed, on 28\u00a0October 2021, by section 3 of the Secondary Legislation Act 2021 (2021 No\u00a07).\n      -----------\n\n\n    # Codes of practice\n\n    222: Approval of codes of practice\n      1. The Minister may\u2014\n        a: approve a code of practice developed by the regulator for the purposes of this Act; and\n        b: amend or revoke an approved code of practice.\n      2. The Minister may approve, amend, or revoke a code of practice under subsection (1) only if the Minister is satisfied that the code of practice, amendment, or revocation was developed by a process that involved consultation between\u2014\n        a: unions; and\n        b: employer organisations; and\n        c: other persons or representatives of other persons affected, or reasonably likely to be affected, by the code, amendment, or revocation.\n      3. A code of practice may incorporate, adopt, or apply (with or without modification) all or any part of any other document that is prepared or issued by any person or body, and that is in force at a particular time.\n      4. However, an approved code of practice may not, without the approval of\u2014\n        a: the relevant Minister,\u2014\n          i: adopt with modification any documents previously approved by a Minister of the Crown; or\n          ii: approve any amendment of any part of a code of practice that comprises a document approved by a Minister of the Crown; or\n        b: the Minister responsible for the administration of the Building Act 2004,\u2014\n          i: adopt an acceptable solution or verification method (or both) issued under section 22(1) of that Act; or\n          ii: approve any amendment of any part of a code of practice that comprises a document approved by that Minister.\n      5. The following may be approved by the Minister without carrying out the consultation required by subsection (2): \n        a: a code of practice that corresponds, or substantially corresponds, to a code of practice made under section 20 of the Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992:\n        b: any minor or technical amendments to an approved code of practice (including the incorporation of amendments to, or updates of, documents incorporated by reference).\n      6. If the Minister approves any amendment in accordance with subsection (5)\ufeff(b), the regulator must make reasonable efforts to notify any affected persons or their representatives of the amendment.\n      7.       \n [repealed] \n      -- Notes --\n      Section 222(7): repealed, on 28\u00a0October 2021, by section 3 of the Secondary Legislation Act 2021 (2021 No\u00a07).\n      -----------\n\n      s 20; Model Work Health and Safety Act (Aust) s 274(1)\u2013(3)\n    223: Publication and commencement of approved code of practice\n      1. As soon as practicable after an approved code of practice has been approved, amended, or revoked, the regulator must ensure that notice of the approval, amendment, or revocation is published in the Gazette.\n      2. Subject to subsection (3), an approved code of practice, an amendment, or a revocation may not come into force until at least 28 days after it has been notified in the Gazette.\n      3. A minor or technical amendment approved by the Minister under section 222(5) comes into force on the date specified by notice in the Gazette.\n      s 20A\n    224: Access to approved codes of practice\n      1. The Gazette notice published by the regulator under section 223(1) must specify the place or places at which copies of the code of practice or amendment (as the case may be) are available for public inspection and purchase.\n      2. The regulator must ensure that the approved code of practice is available\u2014\n        a: free of charge on an Internet site maintained by or on behalf of the regulator; and\n        b: for purchase in hard copy at a reasonable charge.\n      s 20C(1)\n    225: Proof of codes of practice\nThe publication by the regulator of a notice under section 223(1) is conclusive proof that the code has been validly made under section 222.\n      s 20A(5)\n    226: Use of approved codes of practice in proceedings\n      1. No code of practice issued or amended under this Part confers rights or obligations capable of enforcement in any civil or criminal proceedings.\n      2. However, an approved code of practice is admissible in any civil or criminal proceedings as evidence of whether or not a duty or obligation under this Act has been complied with.\n      3. The court may\u2014\n        a: have regard to the code as evidence of what is known about a hazard or risk, risk assessment, or risk control to which the code relates; and\n        b: rely on the code in determining what is reasonably practicable in the circumstances to which the code relates.\n      4. Nothing in this section prevents a person from introducing evidence of compliance with this Act in a manner that is different from the code but provides a standard of work health and safety that is equivalent to or higher than the standard required in the code.\n      s 20B; Model Work Health and Safety Act (Aust) s 275\n\n    # Safe work instruments\n\n    227: Minister may approve safe work instruments\n      1. The Minister may\u2014\n        a: approve a safe work instrument developed by the regulator for the purposes referred to in subsection (2); and\n        b: amend or revoke a safe work instrument approved under paragraph (a).\n      2. The purposes of safe work instruments are to define terms, prescribe matters, or make other provision in relation to any activity or thing, including (without limitation) listing standards, control of substances, and competency requirements.\n      3. The Minister must not approve a safe work instrument unless the Minister is satisfied that all persons and organisations that the Minister thinks appropriate have been consulted, having regard to the subject matter of the proposed safe work instrument.\n      4. The Minister may approve an amendment to a safe work instrument (including approving incorporation of amendments to, or updates of, documents incorporated by reference) without complying with subsection (3) if the Minister is satisfied that the amendment is minor or technical.\n      5. To the extent that a safe work instrument is given effect to in accordance with section 228(1), it is secondary legislation (see Part 3 of the Legislation Act 2019 for publication requirements).\n      5A. To the extent that a safe work instrument is not secondary legislation, subsection (6) applies.\n      6. The Minister must, as soon as practicable after a safe work instrument is made,\u2014\n        a: notify the safe work instrument in the Gazette; and\n        b: ensure that a copy of the safe work instrument is available\u2014\n          i: free of charge on an Internet site maintained by or on behalf of the regulator; and\n          ii: for purchase in hard copy at a reasonable charge.\n      7. A failure to comply with subsection (3) does not affect the validity of a safe work instrument.\n      -- Notes --\n      The following table is small in size and has 3 columns that are grouped under the heading Legislation Act 2019 requirements for secondary legislation made under this section.Legislation Act 2019 requirements for secondary legislation made under this sectionPublicationThe maker must:  LA19 ss 73, 74(1)\ufeff(a), Sch 1 cl\u00a014\u2022\tnotify it in the Gazette\u2022\tmake it available on a website maintained by, or on behalf of, the regulator\u2022\tmake it available for purchase in hard copy at a reasonable chargePresentationThe Minister must present it to the House of RepresentativesLA19 s 114DisallowanceIt may be disallowed by the House of Representatives LA19 ss 115, 116This note is not part of the Act.\n      Section 227(5): replaced, on 28\u00a0October 2021, by section 3 of the Secondary Legislation Act 2021 (2021 No\u00a07).\n      Section 227(5A): inserted, on 28\u00a0October 2021, by section 3 of the Secondary Legislation Act 2021 (2021 No\u00a07).\n      -----------\n\n    228: Legal effect of safe work instruments\n      1. A safe work instrument made under section 227 has legal effect only to the extent that any regulations made under the relevant health and safety legislation refer to it.\n      2. For the purposes of subsection (1), regulations may refer to\u2014\n        a: a particular safe work instrument as amended or replaced from time to time; or\n        b: any safe work instrument that may be made for the purposes of regulations (even if the instrument has not been made at the time the regulations are made).\n\n    # General provisions\n\n    229: Minister may delegate approval of codes of practice and safe work instruments to regulator\n      1. The Minister may, either generally or particularly, delegate to the regulator his or her power\u2014\n        a: under section 222 to approve, amend, or revoke a code of practice:\n        b: under section 227 to approve, amend, or revoke a safe work instrument.\n      2. A delegation under this section must be in writing.\n      3. The regulator must not delegate the power to approve, amend, or revoke a code of practice or a safe work instrument delegated to it under subsection (1) except in accordance with the terms of the delegation.\n      4. The power of the Minister to delegate under this section\u2014\n        a: is subject to any prohibitions, restrictions, or conditions contained in any other Act in relation to the delegation of the Minister's functions or powers; but\n        b: does not limit any power of delegation conferred on the Minister by any other Act.\n      5. The regulator may exercise the power delegated to it under this section in the same manner and with the same effect as if it had been conferred on the regulator (subject to any restrictions or conditions imposed under the delegation).\n      6. If the regulator purports to act under a delegation under this section, the regulator must, in the absence of proof to the contrary, be presumed to be acting in accordance with the terms of the delegation.\n      7. No delegation affects or prevents the performance or exercise of any function or power by the Minister or affects the responsibility of the Minister for the actions of a person acting under the delegation.\n    230: Relationship between regulations relating to hazardous substances under this Act and Resource Management Act 1991\n      1.       \n [repealed] \n      2.       \n [repealed] \n      3. Nothing prescribed in regulations made under this Act for the safe use, handling, manufacture, or storage of hazardous substances applies in relation to any resource consent to which this subsection applies that is\u2014\n        a: a land use consent relating to the use, handling, manufacture, or storage of any hazardous substance; or\n        b: a coastal permit to do something that would otherwise contravene section 15 of the Resource Management Act 1991; or\n        c: a discharge permit.\n      4. Subsection (3) applies where the resource consent concerned was granted before the coming into force of any regulations made under the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1996 and until such time as the conditions on the resource consent are reviewed in accordance with section 128 of the Resource Management Act 1991.\n      5.

A worker may cease, or refuse to carry out, work if the worker believes that carrying out the work would expose the worker, or any other person, to a serious risk to the worker's or other person's health or safety arising from an immediate or imminent exposure to a hazard.\n      2. A worker may continue to refuse to carry out the work if\u2014\n        a: the worker attempts to resolve the matter with the PCBU as soon as practicable after first refusing to do the work; and\n        b: the matter is not resolved; and\n        c: the worker believes on reasonable grounds that carrying out the work would expose the worker or any other person to a serious risk to the worker's or other person's health or safety arising from an immediate or imminent exposure to a hazard.\n      3. Without limiting subsection (2)\ufeff(c), reasonable grounds exist if a health and safety representative has advised the worker that carrying out the work would expose the worker or any other person to a serious risk to the worker's or other person's health or safety arising from an immediate or imminent exposure to a hazard.\n      4. A worker who ceases work under subsection (1) must, as soon as practicable, notify the PCBU that the worker has ceased work.\n      5. Subsection (1) does not authorise a worker to refuse to do work that, because of its nature, inherently or usually carries an understood risk to the worker\u2019s health and safety, unless that risk has materially increased beyond the understood risk.\n      6. To avoid doubt, nothing in this section limits or affects an employee\u2019s right to refuse to do work under any other enactment or the general law.\n      s 28A; Model Work Health and Safety Act (Aust) ss 84, 86\n    84: Health and safety representative may direct unsafe work to cease\n      1. A health and safety representative may direct a worker who is in a work group represented by the representative to cease work if the representative reasonably believes that carrying out the work would expose the worker, or any other person, to a serious risk to the worker's or other person's health or safety, arising from an immediate or imminent exposure to a hazard.\n      2. The health and safety representative must not give a direction under subsection (1) unless the matter is not resolved within a reasonable time after consultation about the matter with the PCBU for whom the workers are carrying out work.\n      3. Despite subsection (2), the health and safety representative may direct the worker to cease work without carrying out that consultation if the risk is so serious and immediate or imminent that it is not reasonable to consult before giving the direction.\n      4. The health and safety representative must carry out the consultation as soon as practicable after giving a direction under subsection (3).\n      5. The health and safety representative must immediately inform the PCBU of any direction given by the health and safety representative to a worker under subsection (1).\n      6. Subsection (1) does not authorise a health and safety representative to give a direction to a worker to cease work that, because of its nature, inherently or usually carries an understood risk to health and safety unless the risk has materially increased beyond the understood risk.\n      s 28A; Model Work Health and Safety Act (Aust) s 85(1), (2), (4), (5)\n    85: Training requirements relating to giving direction to cease work\nA health and safety representative must not give a direction under section 84 to cease work unless the representative has\u2014\n      a: completed training prescribed by or under regulations; or\n      b: previously completed that training when acting as a health and safety representative for another work group.\n    86: Alternative work\n      1. If a worker ceases work, the PCBU may direct the worker to carry out alternative work at the same or another workplace if that work is safe and appropriate for the worker to carry out until the worker can resume normal duties.\n      2. A worker who ceases work must remain available to carry out alternative work as directed by the PCBU under subsection (1).\n      3. For the purposes of this section, alternative work means,\u2014\n        a: for a worker who is an employee, work within the scope of the person's employment agreement:\n        b: for a worker who is not an employee, work within the scope of the worker's contract.\n      4. In addition, a worker may agree (but cannot be directed) to do other work that is safe and appropriate for the worker.\n      s 28A(6); Model Work Health and Safety Act (Aust) s 87\n    87: Regulator may assist to resolve issues relating to cessation of work\n      1. The health and safety representative, the PCBU, or the worker may ask the regulator to assist in resolving the issue relating to the cessation of work.\n      2. If the regulator agrees to assist in resolving an issue relating to the cessation of work, the regulator must provide the assistance as soon as practicable after agreeing to assist.\n  Subpart 5: Prohibition of adverse, coercive, or misleading conduct\n    88: Meaning of adverse conduct\n      1. For the purposes of this subpart, a person engages in adverse conduct if\u2014\n        a: the person\u2014\n          i: dismisses a worker who is an employee; or\n          ii: terminates a contract for services with a worker; or\n          iii: refuses or omits to employ or engage any person on work of any description that is available and for which that person is qualified; or\n          iv: refuses or omits to offer or afford to the worker the same terms of employment or engagement, conditions of work, fringe benefits, or opportunities for training, promotion, and transfer as are made available to other workers of the same or substantially similar qualifications, experience, or skills who are employed or engaged in the same or substantially similar circumstances; or\n          v: subjects the worker to any detriment, in circumstances in which other workers employed or engaged by the person on work of that description are not or would not be subjected to such detriment; or\n          vi: retires the worker, or requires or causes the worker to retire or resign or terminate a contract for services; or\n        b: the person terminates a commercial arrangement with another person; or\n        c: the person refuses or fails to enter into a commercial arrangement with another person.\n      2.

This section applies if the regulator considers that it will not be able to file a charging document by the end of the 12-month period specified in section 146(1)\ufeff(a).\n      2. The District Court may, on application by the regulator made before the end of the 12-month period specified in section 146(1)\ufeff(a), extend the time available for filing a charging document for a further period not exceeding 12 months from the date of expiry of the 12-month period specified in section 146(1)\ufeff(a).\n      3. The court must not grant an extension under subsection (2) unless it is satisfied that\u2014\n        a: the regulator reasonably requires longer than the 12-month period to decide whether to file a charging document; and\n        b: the reason for requiring the longer period is that the investigation of the events and issues surrounding the alleged offence is complex or time consuming; and\n        c: it is in the public interest in the circumstances that a charging document is able to be filed after the 12-month period expires; and\n        d: filing the charging document after the 12-month period expires will not unfairly prejudice the proposed defendant in defending the charge.\n      4. The court must give the following persons an opportunity to be heard:\n        a: the regulator:\n        b: the proposed defendant:\n        c: any other person who has an interest in whether or not a charging document should be filed, being a person described in section 142(1).\n      s 54D\n    148: Limitation period for private prosecutions\nDespite section 25 of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011, proceedings for an offence against this Act may be brought by a person other than the regulator within the latest of the following periods to occur:\n      a: within 2 years after the date on which the incident, situation, or set of circumstances to which the offence relates first became known, or ought reasonably to have become known, to the regulator:\n      b: within 6 months after the date on which a coroner completes and signs a certificate of findings under section 94 of the Coroners Act 2006 if it appears from the certificate of findings (or the proceedings of an inquiry) that an offence has been committed under this Act:\n      c: within 3 months after the date of expiry of any extension granted to the regulator under section 147(2):\n      d: if an enforceable undertaking has been given in relation to the offence, within 6 months after\u2014\n        i: the enforceable undertaking is contravened; or\n        ii: it comes to the notice of the regulator that the enforceable undertaking has been contravened; or\n        iii: the regulator has agreed under section 128 to the withdrawal of the enforceable undertaking.\n    149: Certain proceedings may be brought after end of limitation period if fresh evidence discovered\nDespite anything in section 146, 147, or 148, the following proceedings may be brought after the end of the applicable limitation period if fresh evidence relevant to the offence is discovered and the court is satisfied that the evidence could not reasonably have been discovered within that period:\n      a: proceedings for an offence against section 47:\n      b: proceedings for an offence against section 48 that relates to the death of a person.\n  Subpart 8: Sentencing for offences\n    150: Application of subpart\nThis subpart applies if a court convicts a person (an offender) or finds an offender guilty of an offence under this Act.\n    151: Sentencing criteria\n      1.

On the application of the regulator, the court may order the offender to pay to the regulator a sum that it thinks just and reasonable towards the costs of the prosecution (including the costs of investigating the offending and any associated costs).\n      2. If the court makes an order under subsection (1), it must not make an order under section 4 of the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967.\n      3.

The court may make an adverse publicity order on its own initiative or on the application of the person prosecuting the offence.\n      3. If the offender fails to give evidence to the regulator in accordance with subsection (1)\ufeff(b), the regulator, or a person authorised in writing by the regulator, may take the action or actions specified in the order.\n      4. However, the regulator may apply to the court for an order authorising the regulator, or a person authorised in writing by the regulator, to take the action or actions specified in the order if\u2014\n        a: the offender gives evidence to the regulator in accordance with subsection (1)\ufeff(b); and\n        b: despite that evidence, the regulator is not satisfied that the offender has taken the action or actions specified in the order in accordance with the order.\n      5. If the court makes an order under subsection (1), the regulator may recover as a debt due to the regulator in any court of competent jurisdiction any reasonable expenses incurred in taking an action under subsection (3) or (4).\n    154: Orders for restoration\n      1.

The court may (with or without recording a conviction) adjourn a proceeding for up to 2 years and make an order for the release of the offender if the offender gives an undertaking with specified conditions (a court-ordered enforceable undertaking).\n      2. A court-ordered enforceable undertaking must specify the following conditions:\n        a: that the offender appears before the court if called on to do so during the period of the adjournment and, if the court so specifies, at the time to which the further hearing is adjourned:\n        b: that the offender does not commit, during the period of the adjournment, any offence against this Act or regulations:\n        c: that the offender observes any special conditions imposed by the court.\n      3.

If, in any civil or criminal proceedings under this Act in respect of any conduct engaged in by a person other than an individual, being conduct in relation to which any provision of this Act or regulations applies, it is necessary to establish the state of mind of the person, it is sufficient to show that an officer, employee, or agent of the person, acting within the scope of his or her actual or apparent authority, had that state of mind.\n      3. In this section, state of mind, in relation to a person, includes the knowledge, intention, opinion, belief, or purpose of the person and the person's reasons for that intention, opinion, belief, or purpose.\n    161: Conduct of directors, employees, or agents attributed\n      1.

An inspector's compliance powers are subject to any conditions or limitations specified in the notice of the inspector's appointment.\n      3. However, the exercise of a compliance power by an inspector is not invalid merely because it did not comply with the conditions specified in the notice of the inspector's appointment.\n      -- Notes --\n      Section 163(1)\ufeff(a): replaced, on 7\u00a0August 2020, by section 135 of the Public Service Act 2020 (2020 No\u00a040).\n      Section 163(1)\ufeff(b): amended, on 7\u00a0August 2020, by section 135 of the Public Service Act 2020 (2020 No\u00a040).\n      -----------\n\n    164: Identity cards\n      1.

The regulator may suspend or end the appointment of an inspector at any time.\n      2. To avoid doubt, a person's appointment as an inspector ends when the person ceases to be eligible for appointment as an inspector.\n    166: Inspectors subject to regulator's directions\n      1. An inspector (whether or not an employee) is subject to directions from the regulator that appointed him or her in the exercise of the inspector's compliance powers.\n      2. A direction under subsection (1) may be of a general nature or may relate to a specified matter or specified class of matter.\n      3. A failure to comply with a direction under subsection (1) does not invalidate the exercise of an inspector's compliance power.\n    167: Regulator has powers of inspector\nThe regulator has all the powers that an inspector has under this Act.\n    168: Powers of entry and inspection\n      1.

The inspector may seize, destroy, or take any other action to reduce or remove the cause of imminent danger.\n      3. The inspector must,\u2014\n        a: before exercising the power under subsection (2), if it is practicable to do so, take a sample of the cause of imminent danger:\n        b: as soon as practicable after exercising the power under subsection (2), give the PCBU written notice of the action taken in relation to the cause of imminent danger.\n    171: Notice of entry\n      1.

This section does not allow an inspector to take a sample from a person's body unless the inspector has that person's informed consent to the taking of the sample.\n      3. If an inspector removes or retains any sample, material, substance, or thing under subsection (1), the inspector must,\u2014\n        a: at the time he or she removes or retains the sample, material, substance, or thing or as soon as practicable after doing so, give the PCBU written notice of\u2014\n          i: what has been (or is being) removed or retained; and\n          ii: why it has been (or is being) removed or retained; and\n          iii: where it will be kept in the meantime; and\n        b: subject to subsections (4) and (5), within 5 working days of removing or retaining any sample, material, substance, or thing, give the PCBU written notice of whether the inspector intends to return it or destroy it.\n      4. If it is practicable to do so, the inspector must return the sample, material, substance, or thing to its owner\u2014\n        a: when it is no longer required for any purpose under relevant health and safety legislation (or any other enactment); or\n        b: if a court earlier orders its return.\n      5. The inspector may destroy any removed or retained sample, material, substance, or thing if\u2014\n        a: it is perishable and has become rotten or has otherwise deteriorated; or\n        b: it is perishable and is likely to become rotten or perish before it can be dealt with under subsection (4); or\n        c: it is likely to pose a risk to public health.\n      6.

The funding levy must be added to, and is deemed to be part of, the Work Account levy, and\u2014\n        a: the funding levy is payable, collected, and remitted, and penalties are payable in respect of it, as if it were the Work Account levy; and\n        b: ACC and the Commissioner of Inland Revenue have all of the powers in respect of the funding levy that they have in respect of the Work Account levy; and\n        c: the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is not required to refer separately to or account separately for, or identify, any funding levy in performing his or her functions in relation to the Work Account levy or the funding levy.\n      4. ACC must, by the 20th day of the month after the month in which ACC receives any funding levy from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, pay the funding levy to the chief executive.\n      5. ACC may charge WorkSafe a fee for collecting the funding levy.\n      6. The chief executive must pay into a Crown Bank Account all of the funding levy that ACC pays to the chief executive.\n      7.

To avoid doubt, this section does not require all of the Crown's costs referred to in the definition of certain Crown costs to be recovered by the funding levy.\n      9.

The provisions are\u2014\n        a: section 12 (which relates to the application of this Act to prescribed high-risk plant):\n        b: section 17 (which defines person conducting a business or undertaking):\n        c: section 19 (which defines worker):\n        d: section 21 (which defines supply):\n        e: section 23 (which defines notifiable injury or illness):\n        f: section 24 (which defines notifiable incident):\n        g: section 37 (which relates to the duty of a PCBU who manages or controls a workplace):\n        h: section 38 (which relates to the duty of a PCBU who manages or controls fixtures, fittings, or plant at a workplace):\n        i: section 55 (which relates to the duty to preserve sites):\n        j: section 211(1)\ufeff(q) (which authorises regulations prescribing exemptions from compliance with regulations):\n        k: section 213 (which authorises regulations relating to exemptions in respect of the Armed Forces).\n\n    # Exemptions\n\n    220: Regulator may grant exemption from compliance with regulations\n      1. The regulator may exempt any person or class of persons from compliance with any provision or provisions of regulations.\n      2. The regulator must not grant an exemption under subsection (1) unless it is satisfied that\u2014\n        a: the extent of the exemption is not broader than is reasonably necessary to address the matters that gave rise to the proposed exemption; and\n        b: the exemption is not inconsistent with the purpose of this Act.\n      3. The regulator may\u2014\n        a: grant the exemption on any terms and conditions that the regulator thinks fit; and\n        b: amend or revoke an exemption; and\n        c: replace an exemption either before or when it expires.\n      4.

The breach of a term or condition of an exemption granted under subsection (1) is a breach of the provision to which the exemption relates (unless the terms of the exemption provide otherwise).\n    221: Status and publication of exemptions granted by regulator\n      1. An exemption under section 220 is secondary legislation (see Part 3 of the Legislation Act 2019 for publication requirements), unless it relates only to 1 or more named persons.\n      1A. If an exemption is secondary legislation, the regulator\u2019s reasons for granting the exemption (including why it is appropriate) must be published with the exemption.\n      2. If an exemption is not secondary legislation, subsections (3), (4), and (5) apply.\n      3.

The Minister may approve, amend, or revoke a code of practice under subsection (1) only if the Minister is satisfied that the code of practice, amendment, or revocation was developed by a process that involved consultation between\u2014\n        a: unions; and\n        b: employer organisations; and\n        c: other persons or representatives of other persons affected, or reasonably likely to be affected, by the code, amendment, or revocation.\n      3. A code of practice may incorporate, adopt, or apply (with or without modification) all or any part of any other document that is prepared or issued by any person or body, and that is in force at a particular time.\n      4. However, an approved code of practice may not, without the approval of\u2014\n        a: the relevant Minister,\u2014\n          i: adopt with modification any documents previously approved by a Minister of the Crown; or\n          ii: approve any amendment of any part of a code of practice that comprises a document approved by a Minister of the Crown; or\n        b: the Minister responsible for the administration of the Building Act 2004,\u2014\n          i: adopt an acceptable solution or verification method (or both) issued under section 22(1) of that Act; or\n          ii: approve any amendment of any part of a code of practice that comprises a document approved by that Minister.\n      5.

If the Minister approves any amendment in accordance with subsection (5)\ufeff(b), the regulator must make reasonable efforts to notify any affected persons or their representatives of the amendment.\n      7.       \n [repealed] \n      -- Notes --\n      Section 222(7): repealed, on 28\u00a0October 2021, by section 3 of the Secondary Legislation Act 2021 (2021 No\u00a07).\n      -----------\n\n      s 20; Model Work Health and Safety Act (Aust) s 274(1)\u2013(3)\n    223: Publication and commencement of approved code of practice\n      1. As soon as practicable after an approved code of practice has been approved, amended, or revoked, the regulator must ensure that notice of the approval, amendment, or revocation is published in the Gazette.\n      2. Subject to subsection (3), an approved code of practice, an amendment, or a revocation may not come into force until at least 28 days after it has been notified in the Gazette.\n      3. A minor or technical amendment approved by the Minister under section 222(5) comes into force on the date specified by notice in the Gazette.\n      s 20A\n    224: Access to approved codes of practice\n      1. The Gazette notice published by the regulator under section 223(1) must specify the place or places at which copies of the code of practice or amendment (as the case may be) are available for public inspection and purchase.\n      2. The regulator must ensure that the approved code of practice is available\u2014\n        a: free of charge on an Internet site maintained by or on behalf of the regulator; and\n        b: for purchase in hard copy at a reasonable charge.\n      s 20C(1)\n    225: Proof of codes of practice\nThe publication by the regulator of a notice under section 223(1) is conclusive proof that the code has been validly made under section 222.\n      s 20A(5)\n    226: Use of approved codes of practice in proceedings\n      1. No code of practice issued or amended under this Part confers rights or obligations capable of enforcement in any civil or criminal proceedings.\n      2. However, an approved code of practice is admissible in any civil or criminal proceedings as evidence of whether or not a duty or obligation under this Act has been complied with.\n      3. The court may\u2014\n        a: have regard to the code as evidence of what is known about a hazard or risk, risk assessment, or risk control to which the code relates; and\n        b: rely on the code in determining what is reasonably practicable in the circumstances to which the code relates.\n      4. Nothing in this section prevents a person from introducing evidence of compliance with this Act in a manner that is different from the code but provides a standard of work health and safety that is equivalent to or higher than the standard required in the code.\n      s 20B; Model Work Health and Safety Act (Aust) s 275\n\n    # Safe work instruments\n\n    227: Minister may approve safe work instruments\n      1.

The purposes of safe work instruments are to define terms, prescribe matters, or make other provision in relation to any activity or thing, including (without limitation) listing standards, control of substances, and competency requirements.\n      3. The Minister must not approve a safe work instrument unless the Minister is satisfied that all persons and organisations that the Minister thinks appropriate have been consulted, having regard to the subject matter of the proposed safe work instrument.\n      4. The Minister may approve an amendment to a safe work instrument (including approving incorporation of amendments to, or updates of, documents incorporated by reference) without complying with subsection (3) if the Minister is satisfied that the amendment is minor or technical.\n      5. To the extent that a safe work instrument is given effect to in accordance with section 228(1), it is secondary legislation (see Part 3 of the Legislation Act 2019 for publication requirements).\n      5A. To the extent that a safe work instrument is not secondary legislation, subsection (6) applies.\n      6. The Minister must, as soon as practicable after a safe work instrument is made,\u2014\n        a: notify the safe work instrument in the Gazette; and\n        b: ensure that a copy of the safe work instrument is available\u2014\n          i: free of charge on an Internet site maintained by or on behalf of the regulator; and\n          ii: for purchase in hard copy at a reasonable charge.\n      7.

For the purposes of subsection (1), regulations may refer to\u2014\n        a: a particular safe work instrument as amended or replaced from time to time; or\n        b: any safe work instrument that may be made for the purposes of regulations (even if the instrument has not been made at the time the regulations are made).\n\n    # General provisions\n\n    229: Minister may delegate approval of codes of practice and safe work instruments to regulator\n      1. The Minister may, either generally or particularly, delegate to the regulator his or her power\u2014\n        a: under section 222 to approve, amend, or revoke a code of practice:\n        b: under section 227 to approve, amend, or revoke a safe work instrument.\n      2. A delegation under this section must be in writing.\n      3. The regulator must not delegate the power to approve, amend, or revoke a code of practice or a safe work instrument delegated to it under subsection (1) except in accordance with the terms of the delegation.\n      4. The power of the Minister to delegate under this section\u2014\n        a: is subject to any prohibitions, restrictions, or conditions contained in any other Act in relation to the delegation of the Minister's functions or powers; but\n        b: does not limit any power of delegation conferred on the Minister by any other Act.\n      5. The regulator may exercise the power delegated to it under this section in the same manner and with the same effect as if it had been conferred on the regulator (subject to any restrictions or conditions imposed under the delegation).\n      6. If the regulator purports to act under a delegation under this section, the regulator must, in the absence of proof to the contrary, be presumed to be acting in accordance with the terms of the delegation.\n      7. No delegation affects or prevents the performance or exercise of any function or power by the Minister or affects the responsibility of the Minister for the actions of a person acting under the delegation.\n    230: Relationship between regulations relating to hazardous substances under this Act and Resource Management Act 1991\n      1.       \n [repealed] \n      2.       \n [repealed] \n      3.

Section 26(2) to (5) of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011 applies to an application for leave under subsection (3)\ufeff(a) with the following modifications:\n      a: a reference to accepting a charging document for filing must be read as if it were a reference to granting leave:\n      b: in determining whether the proposed prosecution is an abuse of process in accordance with section 26(3)\ufeff(b) of that Act, the Judge must take into account\u2014\n        i: whether allowing the proposed prosecution to proceed would be consistent with the purpose of this Act; and\n        ii: whether the proposed prosecution is in the public interest.\n    s 54A(2), (3)\n  145: Continuing or repeated matters\nNothing in this Act prevents the regulator or another person from taking enforcement action in respect of an incident, situation, or set of circumstances despite enforcement action having been taken in respect of that incident, situation, or set of circumstances, if the incident, situation, or set of circumstances is continuing or repeated.\n    s 54E\n\n  # Limitation periods for prosecutions\n\n  146: Limitation period for prosecutions brought by regulator\n    1. Despite section 25 of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011, proceedings for an offence under this Act may be brought by the regulator within the latest of the following periods to occur:\n      a: within 12 months after the date on which the incident, situation, or set of circumstances to which the offence relates first became known, or ought reasonably to have become known, to the regulator:\n      b: within 6 months after the date on which a coroner completes and signs a certificate of findings under section 94 of the Coroners Act 2006 if it appears from the certificate of findings (or the proceedings of an inquiry) that an offence has been committed under this Act:\n      c: if an enforceable undertaking has been given in relation to the offence, within 6 months after\u2014\n        i: the enforceable undertaking is contravened; or\n        ii: it comes to the notice of the regulator that the enforceable undertaking has been contravened; or\n        iii: the regulator has agreed under section 128 to the withdrawal of the enforceable undertaking.\n    2.

This section applies if the regulator considers that it will not be able to file a charging document by the end of the 12-month period specified in section 146(1)\ufeff(a).\n    2. The District Court may, on application by the regulator made before the end of the 12-month period specified in section 146(1)\ufeff(a), extend the time available for filing a charging document for a further period not exceeding 12 months from the date of expiry of the 12-month period specified in section 146(1)\ufeff(a).\n    3. The court must not grant an extension under subsection (2) unless it is satisfied that\u2014\n      a: the regulator reasonably requires longer than the 12-month period to decide whether to file a charging document; and\n      b: the reason for requiring the longer period is that the investigation of the events and issues surrounding the alleged offence is complex or time consuming; and\n      c: it is in the public interest in the circumstances that a charging document is able to be filed after the 12-month period expires; and\n      d: filing the charging document after the 12-month period expires will not unfairly prejudice the proposed defendant in defending the charge.\n    4. The court must give the following persons an opportunity to be heard:\n      a: the regulator:\n      b: the proposed defendant:\n      c: any other person who has an interest in whether or not a charging document should be filed, being a person described in section 142(1).\n    s 54D\n  148: Limitation period for private prosecutions\nDespite section 25 of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011, proceedings for an offence against this Act may be brought by a person other than the regulator within the latest of the following periods to occur:\n    a: within 2 years after the date on which the incident, situation, or set of circumstances to which the offence relates first became known, or ought reasonably to have become known, to the regulator:\n    b: within 6 months after the date on which a coroner completes and signs a certificate of findings under section 94 of the Coroners Act 2006 if it appears from the certificate of findings (or the proceedings of an inquiry) that an offence has been committed under this Act:\n    c: within 3 months after the date of expiry of any extension granted to the regulator under section 147(2):\n    d: if an enforceable undertaking has been given in relation to the offence, within 6 months after\u2014\n      i: the enforceable undertaking is contravened; or\n      ii: it comes to the notice of the regulator that the enforceable undertaking has been contravened; or\n      iii: the regulator has agreed under section 128 to the withdrawal of the enforceable undertaking.\n  149: Certain proceedings may be brought after end of limitation period if fresh evidence discovered\nDespite anything in section 146, 147, or 148, the following proceedings may be brought after the end of the applicable limitation period if fresh evidence relevant to the offence is discovered and the court is satisfied that the evidence could not reasonably have been discovered within that period:\n    a: proceedings for an offence against section 47:\n    b: proceedings for an offence against section 48 that relates to the death of a person.", "context": {"act_name": "Health and Safety at Work Act 2015", "act_number": "70", "act_year": "2015", "schedule_label": null, "schedule_name": null, "part_label": "4", "part_name": "Enforcement and other matters", "subpart_label": "7", "subpart_name": "Criminal proceedings", "crosshead_name": null, "section_label": null, "section_name": null, "paragraph_label": []}}, {"chunk_id": "Health and Safety at Work Act 2015, Part 4, Subpart 8", "order": 4059, "text": "Subpart 8: Sentencing for offences\n  150: Application of subpart\nThis subpart applies if a court convicts a person (an offender) or finds an offender guilty of an offence under this Act.\n  151: Sentencing criteria\n    1.

This section does not allow an inspector to take a sample from a person's body unless the inspector has that person's informed consent to the taking of the sample.\n    3. If an inspector removes or retains any sample, material, substance, or thing under subsection (1), the inspector must,\u2014\n      a: at the time he or she removes or retains the sample, material, substance, or thing or as soon as practicable after doing so, give the PCBU written notice of\u2014\n        i: what has been (or is being) removed or retained; and\n        ii: why it has been (or is being) removed or retained; and\n        iii: where it will be kept in the meantime; and\n      b: subject to subsections (4) and (5), within 5 working days of removing or retaining any sample, material, substance, or thing, give the PCBU written notice of whether the inspector intends to return it or destroy it.\n    4. If it is practicable to do so, the inspector must return the sample, material, substance, or thing to its owner\u2014\n      a: when it is no longer required for any purpose under relevant health and safety legislation (or any other enactment); or\n      b: if a court earlier orders its return.\n    5.

As soon as practicable after an approved code of practice has been approved, amended, or revoked, the regulator must ensure that notice of the approval, amendment, or revocation is published in the Gazette.\n    2. Subject to subsection (3), an approved code of practice, an amendment, or a revocation may not come into force until at least 28 days after it has been notified in the Gazette.\n    3. A minor or technical amendment approved by the Minister under section 222(5) comes into force on the date specified by notice in the Gazette.\n    s 20A\n  224: Access to approved codes of practice\n    1.

The regulator must ensure that the approved code of practice is available\u2014\n      a: free of charge on an Internet site maintained by or on behalf of the regulator; and\n      b: for purchase in hard copy at a reasonable charge.\n    s 20C(1)\n  225: Proof of codes of practice\nThe publication by the regulator of a notice under section 223(1) is conclusive proof that the code has been validly made under section 222.\n    s 20A(5)\n  226: Use of approved codes of practice in proceedings\n    1. No code of practice issued or amended under this Part confers rights or obligations capable of enforcement in any civil or criminal proceedings.\n    2. However, an approved code of practice is admissible in any civil or criminal proceedings as evidence of whether or not a duty or obligation under this Act has been complied with.\n    3. The court may\u2014\n      a: have regard to the code as evidence of what is known about a hazard or risk, risk assessment, or risk control to which the code relates; and\n      b: rely on the code in determining what is reasonably practicable in the circumstances to which the code relates.\n    4. Nothing in this section prevents a person from introducing evidence of compliance with this Act in a manner that is different from the code but provides a standard of work health and safety that is equivalent to or higher than the standard required in the code.\n    s 20B; Model Work Health and Safety Act (Aust) s 275\n\n  # Safe work instruments\n\n  227: Minister may approve safe work instruments\n    1.

The purposes of safe work instruments are to define terms, prescribe matters, or make other provision in relation to any activity or thing, including (without limitation) listing standards, control of substances, and competency requirements.\n    3. The Minister must not approve a safe work instrument unless the Minister is satisfied that all persons and organisations that the Minister thinks appropriate have been consulted, having regard to the subject matter of the proposed safe work instrument.\n    4. The Minister may approve an amendment to a safe work instrument (including approving incorporation of amendments to, or updates of, documents incorporated by reference) without complying with subsection (3) if the Minister is satisfied that the amendment is minor or technical.\n    5. To the extent that a safe work instrument is given effect to in accordance with section 228(1), it is secondary legislation (see Part 3 of the Legislation Act 2019 for publication requirements).\n    5A. To the extent that a safe work instrument is not secondary legislation, subsection (6) applies.\n    6. The Minister must, as soon as practicable after a safe work instrument is made,\u2014\n      a: notify the safe work instrument in the Gazette; and\n      b: ensure that a copy of the safe work instrument is available\u2014\n        i: free of charge on an Internet site maintained by or on behalf of the regulator; and\n        ii: for purchase in hard copy at a reasonable charge.\n    7.

A delegation under this section must be in writing.\n    3. The regulator must not delegate the power to approve, amend, or revoke a code of practice or a safe work instrument delegated to it under subsection (1) except in accordance with the terms of the delegation.\n    4. The power of the Minister to delegate under this section\u2014\n      a: is subject to any prohibitions, restrictions, or conditions contained in any other Act in relation to the delegation of the Minister's functions or powers; but\n      b: does not limit any power of delegation conferred on the Minister by any other Act.\n    5. The regulator may exercise the power delegated to it under this section in the same manner and with the same effect as if it had been conferred on the regulator (subject to any restrictions or conditions imposed under the delegation).\n    6. If the regulator purports to act under a delegation under this section, the regulator must, in the absence of proof to the contrary, be presumed to be acting in accordance with the terms of the delegation.\n    7. No delegation affects or prevents the performance or exercise of any function or power by the Minister or affects the responsibility of the Minister for the actions of a person acting under the delegation.\n  230: Relationship between regulations relating to hazardous substances under this Act and Resource Management Act 1991\n    1.     \n [repealed] \n    2.     \n [repealed] \n    3.
