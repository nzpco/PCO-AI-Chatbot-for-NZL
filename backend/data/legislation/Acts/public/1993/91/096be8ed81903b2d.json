Where the goods fail to comply with the guarantee in this section,\u2014\n      a: Part 2 may give the consumer a right of redress against the supplier; and\n      b: Part 3 may give the consumer a right of redress against the manufacturer.\n    1908 No\u00a0168 s 16(b); \n    1971 No\u00a0147 s\u00a012; \n    Consumer Products Warranties Act 1977 s\u00a011(4), (7) (Saskatchewan)\n  7: Meaning of acceptable quality\n    1. For the purposes of section 6, goods are of acceptable quality if they are as\u2014\n      a: fit for all the purposes for which goods of the type in question are commonly supplied; and\n      b: acceptable in appearance and finish; and\n      c: free from minor defects; and\n      d: safe; and\n      e: durable,\u2014\n      as a reasonable consumer fully acquainted with the state and condition of the goods, including any hidden defects, would regard as acceptable, having regard to\u2014\n      f: the nature of the goods:\n      g: the price (where relevant):\n      h: any statements made about the goods on any packaging or label on the goods:\n      ha: the nature of the supplier and the context in which the supplier supplies the goods:\n      i: any representation made about the goods by the supplier or the manufacturer:\n      j: all other relevant circumstances of the supply of the goods.\n    2. Where any defects in goods have been specifically drawn to the consumer's attention before he or she agreed to the supply, then notwithstanding that a reasonable consumer may not have regarded the goods as acceptable with those defects, the goods will not fail to comply with the guarantee as to acceptable quality by reason only of those defects.\n    3. Where goods are displayed for sale or hire, the defects that are to be treated as having been specifically drawn to the consumer's attention for the purposes of subsection (2) are those disclosed on a written notice displayed with the goods.\n    4. Goods will not fail to comply with the guarantee of acceptable quality if\u2014\n      a: the goods have been used in a manner, or to an extent which is inconsistent with the manner or extent of use that a reasonable consumer would expect to obtain from the goods; and\n      b: the goods would have complied with the guarantee of acceptable quality if they had not been used in that manner or to that extent.\n    5. A reference in subsections (2) and (3) to a defect means any failure of the goods to comply with the guarantee of acceptable quality.\n    -- Notes --\n    Section 7(1)\ufeff(ha): inserted, on 17\u00a0June 2014, by section 8 of the Consumer Guarantees Amendment Act 2013 (2013 No\u00a0144).\n    -----------\n\n    Consumer Products Warranties Act 1977 ss\u00a02(a), 34 (Saskatchewan)\n  7A: Guarantee of acceptable quality in supply of gas and electricity\n    1. There is a guarantee that the supply of gas by a gas retailer, and the supply of electricity by an electricity retailer, to a consumer is of an acceptable quality.\n    2. The guarantee of acceptable quality is a guarantee that\u2014\n      a: the supply of gas or electricity is as safe as a reasonable consumer would expect it to be; and\n      b: the supply of gas or electricity to a place is as reliable as a reasonable consumer would expect a supply to that place to be; and\n      c: the quality of the gas or electricity supplied is such that it can be consistently used for the things that a reasonable consumer would expect to use gas or electricity for.\n    3. When determining what a reasonable consumer would expect, it is assumed that the consumer has considered\u2014\n      a: that the supply of gas or electricity may be affected by emergencies, or other events or circumstances, outside the control of the retailer or any other person involved in the supply of gas or electricity; and\n      b: that the supply of gas or electricity may be interrupted for safety, maintenance, or other technical reasons; and\n      c: that the quality of gas or electricity supplied may fluctuate, but that fluctuations are acceptable only within tolerances permitted by gas and electricity safety regulations; and\n      d: that the reliability and quality of the supply of gas or electricity may vary depending on the location of the place to which the gas or electricity is supplied; and\n      e: that reliability and quality of supply may be related to price.\n    4. The supply of gas or electricity will not fail to comply with the guarantee of acceptable quality\u2014\n      a: if the gas or electricity has been used by the consumer in an unreasonable manner or to an unreasonable extent, and the supply of gas or electricity would have complied with the guarantee of acceptable quality if it had not been used in that manner or to that extent; or\n      b: if, in a case where the quality and reliability of supply by a gas or electricity retailer to a particular consumer is likely to be significantly worse than the quality and reliability of supply that generally applies to gas or electricity supplied by the retailer,\u2014\n        i: the retailer or the person supplying line function services has specifically explained to the consumer the ways in which the supply is likely to be significantly worse; and\n        ii: the consumer has accepted the supply on that basis, even if an otherwise reasonable consumer may not regard that supply as acceptable.\n    5. In this section and section 7B,\u2014\n      electricity retailer means a retailer as defined in the Electricity Industry Act 2010\n      gas retailer means a gas retailer as defined in the Gas Act 1992.\n    -- Notes --\n    Section 7A: inserted, on 17\u00a0June 2014, by section 9 of the Consumer Guarantees Amendment Act 2013 (2013 No\u00a0144).\n    -----------\n\n  7B: Relationship of section 7A with rest of Act\n    1. For the purposes of this Act, except as described in this section, gas (other than non-reticulated gas) and electricity are not to be treated as being goods, and the supply of gas or electricity by retailers is not to be treated as the supply of a service.\n    2. If the supply of gas or electricity fails to comply with the guarantee of acceptable quality in section 7A, in order that Part 2 may apply to give consumers a right of redress against gas retailers and electricity retailers, that Part must be applied as if gas and electricity were goods, and as if gas retailers and electricity retailers were the suppliers of those goods.\n    3. For the purpose of applying the provisions of Part 5 to the supply of gas and electricity to consumers, that Part must be applied as if gas and electricity were goods, and as if gas retailers and electricity retailers were the suppliers of those goods.\n    4. To avoid doubt, the guarantee provided by section 7A is the only guarantee provided under this Act that relates to the supply of gas (other than non-reticulated gas) or electricity by gas retailers and electricity retailers.\n    -- Notes --\n    Section 7B: inserted, on 17\u00a0June 2014, by section 9 of the Consumer Guarantees Amendment Act 2013 (2013 No\u00a0144).\n    -----------\n\n  8: Guarantees as to fitness for particular purpose\n    1. Subject to section 41, the following guarantees apply where goods are supplied to a consumer:\n      a: that the goods are reasonably fit for any particular purpose that the consumer makes known, expressly or by implication, to the supplier as the purpose for which the goods are being acquired by the consumer; and\n      b: that the goods are reasonably fit for any particular purpose for which the supplier represents that they are or will be fit.\n    2. Those guarantees do not apply where the circumstances show that\u2014\n      a: the consumer does not rely on the supplier's skill or judgment; or\n      b: it is unreasonable for the consumer to rely on the supplier's skill or judgment.\n    3. This section applies whether or not the purpose is a purpose for which the goods are commonly supplied.\n    4. Part 2 gives the consumer a right of redress against the supplier where the goods fail to comply with any guarantee in this section.\n    1908 No\u00a0168 s 16(a); \n    1971 No\u00a0147 s\u00a013\n  9: Guarantee that goods comply with description\n    1. Subject to section 41, where goods are supplied by description to a consumer, there is a guarantee that the goods correspond with the description.\n    2. A supply of goods is not prevented from being a supply by description by reason only that, being exposed for sale or hire, they are selected by a consumer.\n    3. If the goods are supplied by reference to a sample or demonstration model as well as by description, the guarantees in this section and in section 10 will both apply.\n    4. Where the goods fail to comply with the guarantee in this section,\u2014\n      a: Part 2 gives the consumer a right of redress against the supplier; and\n      b: Part 3 may give the consumer a right of redress against the manufacturer.\n    1908 No\u00a0168 s 15; \n    1971 No\u00a0147 s 14(2); \n    Trade Practices Act 1974 s\u00a070(2) (Aust)\n  10: Guarantee that goods comply with sample\n    1. Subject to section 41, the following guarantees apply where goods are supplied to a consumer by reference to a sample or demonstration model:\n      a: that the goods correspond with the sample or demonstration model in quality; and\n      b: that the consumer will have a reasonable opportunity to compare the goods with the sample.\n    2. If the goods are supplied by reference to a sample or demonstration model as well as by description, the guarantees in this section and section 9 will both apply.\n    3. Part 2 gives the consumer a right of redress against the supplier where the goods fail to comply with any guarantee in this section.\n    1908 No\u00a0168 s 17; \n    1971 No\u00a0147 s\u00a014(1)\n  11: Guarantee as to price\n    1. Subject to section 41, where goods are supplied to a consumer there is a guarantee that the consumer is not liable to pay to the supplier more than a reasonable price for the goods in any case where the price for the goods is not\u2014\n      a: determined by the contract; nor\n      b: left to be determined in a manner agreed by the contract; nor\n      c: left to be determined by the course of dealing between the parties.\n    2.

There is a guarantee that the supply of gas by a gas retailer, and the supply of electricity by an electricity retailer, to a consumer is of an acceptable quality.\n    2. The guarantee of acceptable quality is a guarantee that\u2014\n      a: the supply of gas or electricity is as safe as a reasonable consumer would expect it to be; and\n      b: the supply of gas or electricity to a place is as reliable as a reasonable consumer would expect a supply to that place to be; and\n      c: the quality of the gas or electricity supplied is such that it can be consistently used for the things that a reasonable consumer would expect to use gas or electricity for.\n    3. When determining what a reasonable consumer would expect, it is assumed that the consumer has considered\u2014\n      a: that the supply of gas or electricity may be affected by emergencies, or other events or circumstances, outside the control of the retailer or any other person involved in the supply of gas or electricity; and\n      b: that the supply of gas or electricity may be interrupted for safety, maintenance, or other technical reasons; and\n      c: that the quality of gas or electricity supplied may fluctuate, but that fluctuations are acceptable only within tolerances permitted by gas and electricity safety regulations; and\n      d: that the reliability and quality of the supply of gas or electricity may vary depending on the location of the place to which the gas or electricity is supplied; and\n      e: that reliability and quality of supply may be related to price.\n    4. The supply of gas or electricity will not fail to comply with the guarantee of acceptable quality\u2014\n      a: if the gas or electricity has been used by the consumer in an unreasonable manner or to an unreasonable extent, and the supply of gas or electricity would have complied with the guarantee of acceptable quality if it had not been used in that manner or to that extent; or\n      b: if, in a case where the quality and reliability of supply by a gas or electricity retailer to a particular consumer is likely to be significantly worse than the quality and reliability of supply that generally applies to gas or electricity supplied by the retailer,\u2014\n        i: the retailer or the person supplying line function services has specifically explained to the consumer the ways in which the supply is likely to be significantly worse; and\n        ii: the consumer has accepted the supply on that basis, even if an otherwise reasonable consumer may not regard that supply as acceptable.\n    5.

For the purposes of this Act, except as described in this section, gas (other than non-reticulated gas) and electricity are not to be treated as being goods, and the supply of gas or electricity by retailers is not to be treated as the supply of a service.\n    2. If the supply of gas or electricity fails to comply with the guarantee of acceptable quality in section 7A, in order that Part 2 may apply to give consumers a right of redress against gas retailers and electricity retailers, that Part must be applied as if gas and electricity were goods, and as if gas retailers and electricity retailers were the suppliers of those goods.\n    3. For the purpose of applying the provisions of Part 5 to the supply of gas and electricity to consumers, that Part must be applied as if gas and electricity were goods, and as if gas retailers and electricity retailers were the suppliers of those goods.\n    4.
