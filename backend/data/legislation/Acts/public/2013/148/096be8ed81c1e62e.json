{"Act": [{"chunk_id": "Auctioneers Act 2013", "order": 731, "text": "Title: Auctioneers Act 2013\nYear: 2013\nId: DLM5788503\nNo: 148\nType: public\nDate Assent: 2013-12-17\nDate As At: 2021-10-28\nAdministered By: None\nDate Reprint: 2021-10-28\nCover Note: The Parliamentary Counsel Office has made editorial and format changes to this version using the powers under subpart 2 of Part 3 of the Legislation Act 2019.\n\nNote 4 at the end of this version provides a list of the amendments included in it.\n\nThis Act is administered by the Ministry of Business, Innovation, and Employment.\n\n1: Title\nThis Act is the Auctioneers Act 2013.\n2: Commencement\nThis Act comes into force on the day after the date on which it receives the Royal assent.\n3: Purpose of Act\nThis Act provides for the registration of auctioneers and for related matters, and repeals the Auctioneers Act 1928.\n4: Interpretation\n  1. In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,\u2014\n    auction means a process in which property of any kind (including goods, services, and interests in land) is offered for sale by an auctioneer on behalf of a vendor, and\u2014\n    a: bids for the property are placed with the auctioneer in real time, whether in person, by telephone, via the Internet, or by any other means; and\n    b: the property is sold when the auctioneer so indicates\n    chief executive means the chief executive of the department of State that, with the authority of the Prime Minister, is for the time being responsible for the administration of this Act\n    person concerned in the management of a company means\u2014\n    a: a director of the company, as that term is defined in section 126 of the Companies Act 1993:\n    b: the chief executive of the company, or any person occupying the equivalent position\n    register means the register of auctioneers maintained by the Registrar under section 21\n    registered auctioneer means an individual or a company that is registered under this Act as an auctioneer\n    Registrar means the Registrar of Auctioneers appointed under section 19\n    vendor, in relation to an auction, means the person whose property is offered for sale by an auctioneer.\n  2. To avoid doubt, a process of selling property is not necessarily an auction for the purpose of this Act just because it is described as an auction. For example, a process described as an Internet auction, but that provides that any contract of sale resulting from the process is a contract directly between the winner of the bidding and the seller of the property, is not an auction for the purpose of this Act.\n\n# Registration requirements\n\n5: Registration of person carrying on business as auctioneer\n  1. A person must not carry on business as an auctioneer unless the person is registered under this Act as a registered auctioneer.\n  2.
