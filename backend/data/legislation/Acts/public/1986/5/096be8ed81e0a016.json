Every price-quality path (whether a default price-quality path or a customised price-quality path under this subpart, or an individual price-quality path under subpart 7) must specify,\u2014\n        a: in relation to prices, either or both of the following with respect to a specified regulatory period:\n          i: the maximum price or prices that may be charged by a regulated supplier:\n          ii: the maximum revenues that may be recovered by a regulated supplier; and\n        b: the quality standards that must be met by the regulated supplier; and\n        c: the regulatory period.\n      2. A price-quality path may include incentives for an individual supplier to maintain or improve its quality of supply, and those incentives may include (without limitation) any of the following:\n        a: penalties by way of a reduction in the supplier's maximum prices or revenues based on whether, or by what amount, the supplier fails to meet the required quality standards:\n        b: rewards by way of an increase in the supplier's maximum prices or revenue based on whether, or by what amount, the supplier meets or exceeds the required quality standards:\n        c: consumer compensation schemes that set minimum standards of performance and require the supplier to pay prescribed amounts of compensation to consumers if it fails to meet those standards:\n        d: reporting requirements, including special reporting requirements in asset management plans, if the supplier fails to meet the quality standards.\n      3. Quality standards may be prescribed in any way the Commission considers appropriate (such as targets, bands, or formulae) and may include (without limitation)\u2014\n        a: responsiveness to consumers; and\n        b: in relation to electricity lines services, reliability of supply, reduction in energy losses, and voltage stability or other technical requirements.\n      4. A regulatory period must be 5\u00a0years.\n      5. However, the Commission may set a shorter period than 5\u00a0years if it considers that it would better meet the purposes of this Part, but in any event may not set a term less than 4\u00a0years.\n      6. Subsections (4) and (5) are subject to section 53W.\n      7. No default price-quality path applies to a supplier until the date specified in the relevant section 52P determination, which must be a date at least 4\u00a0months after the determination is published as referred to in section 52P(9).\n      -- Notes --\n      Section 53M: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n      Section 53M(7): amended, on 28\u00a0October 2021, by section 3 of the Secondary Legislation Act 2021 (2021 No\u00a07).\n      -----------\n\n    53N: Monitoring compliance with price-quality paths\nFor the purpose of monitoring compliance with a price-quality path (whether a default price-quality path or a customised price-quality path under this subpart, or an individual price-quality path under subpart 7), the Commission may, in addition to exercising its powers under section 98, issue a written notice to a regulated supplier requiring it to provide any or all of the following:\n      a: a written statement that states whether or not the supplier has complied with the price-quality path applying to that supplier:\n      b: a report on the written statement referred to in paragraph (a) that is signed by an auditor in accordance with any form specified by the Commission:\n      c: sufficient information to enable the Commission to properly determine whether all applicable price-quality paths have been complied with:\n      d: a certificate, in the form specified by the Commission and signed by at least 1\u00a0director of the supplier, confirming the truth and accuracy of any information provided under this section.\n      -- Notes --\n      Section 53N: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n      -----------\n\n\n    # Default price-quality path\n\n    -- Notes --\n    Heading: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n    -----------\n\n    53O: Section 52P determination to set out requirements of default price-quality paths\nIf default price-quality regulation applies to regulated goods or services, the section 52P determination must set out a default price-quality path that includes\u2014\n      a: the starting prices that apply to the supply of the goods or services during the first regulatory period; and\n      b: the rate or rates of change in prices, relative to the Consumers Price Index, allowed during the first regulatory period; and\n      c: the quality standards that apply during the first regulatory period; and\n      d: the date or dates on which the default price-quality path (or any part of it) takes effect; and\n      e: the annual date by which any proposal for a customised price-quality path must be received; and\n      f: the annual date by which compliance must be demonstrated in accordance with section 53N.\n      -- Notes --\n      Section 53O: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n      Section 53O(b): amended, on 1\u00a0September 2022, by section 107(1) of the Data and Statistics Act 2022 (2022 No\u00a039).\n      -----------\n\n    53P: Resetting starting prices, rates of change, and quality standards\n      1. Before the end of the first and every subsequent regulatory period, the Commission must amend the section 52P determination by setting out the starting prices (as referred to in section 53O(a)), rates of change (as referred to in section 53O(b)), and quality standards (as referred to in section 53O(c)) that apply for the following regulatory period.\n      2. In resetting starting prices, rates of change, and quality standards, the Commission must consult with interested parties.\n      3. The starting prices must be either\u2014\n        a: the prices that applied at the end of the preceding regulatory period; or\n        b: prices, determined by the Commission, that are based on the current and projected profitability of each supplier.\n      4. Starting prices set in accordance with subsection (3)\ufeff(b) must not seek to recover any excessive profits made during any earlier period.\n      5. Subject to subsection (8), the Commission must set only 1\u00a0rate of change per type of regulated goods or services (for example, if the rate of change (x) is 1% in a CPI\u2212x path, 1% must be the rate for all goods or services of that type).\n      6. The rate of change must be based on the long-run average productivity improvement rate achieved by either or both of suppliers in New Zealand, and suppliers in other comparable countries, of the relevant goods or services, using whatever measures of productivity the Commission considers appropriate.\n      7. When setting the rate of change, the Commission may take into account the effects of inflation on the inputs of suppliers of the relevant goods or services.\n      8. The Commission may set alternative rates of change for a particular supplier\u2014\n        a: as an alternative, in whole or in part, to the starting prices set under subsection (3)\ufeff(b) if, in the Commission's opinion, this is necessary or desirable to minimise any undue financial hardship to the supplier or to minimise price shock to consumers; or\n        b: as an incentive (under section 53M(2)) for the supplier to improve its quality of supply.\n      9. Any alternative rates of change set under subsection (8) may include step changes.\n      10. The Commission may not, for the purposes of this section, use comparative benchmarking on efficiency in order to set starting prices, rates of change, quality standards, or incentives to improve quality of supply.\n      11. If starting prices, rates of change, and quality standards have not been set by way of an amendment to the relevant section 52P determination by the end of the regulatory period to which it applies, the starting prices, rates of change, and quality standards that apply at the end of the regulatory period continue to apply until the reset starting prices, rates of change, and quality standards are set.\n      -- Notes --\n      Section 53P: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n      -----------\n\n\n    # Customised price-quality paths\n\n    -- Notes --\n    Heading: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n    -----------\n\n    53Q: Supplier may propose customised price-quality path\n      1. At any time after a default price-quality path is set by the Commission, a supplier that is (or is likely to be) subject to the default price-quality path may make a proposal to the Commission for a customised price-quality path to apply to that supplier.\n      2. Every proposal must\u2014\n        a: comply with the input methodologies referred to in section 52T(1)\ufeff(d) relating to the process for, and content of, customised price-quality path proposals; and\n        b: be made within the period, or by the annual date, specified for the purpose in the section 52P determination; and\n        c: include the standard application fee for customised price-quality path proposals; and\n        d: apply or adopt all relevant input methodologies.\n      3. A supplier may make only 1 proposal during a regulatory period, and may not make a proposal within the 12\u00a0months before a default price-quality path is due to be reset.\n      4. A supplier that makes a proposal must make it publicly available as soon as practicable after it has been made to the Commission.\n      -- Notes --\n      Section 53Q: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n      -----------\n\n    53R: Effect of making proposal for customised price-quality path\nA supplier that makes a proposal to the Commission\u2014\n      a: cannot withdraw the proposal; and\n      b: is bound, for the regulatory period to which it applies, by any customised price-quality path that the Commission subsequently sets for the supplier.\n      -- Notes --\n      Section 53R: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n      -----------\n\n    53S: Preliminary assessment of proposal\n      1. Within 40 working days after receiving a proposal, the Commission must determine whether the proposal complies with the input methodologies referred to in section 52T(1)\ufeff(d) relating to the process for, and content of, customised price-quality path proposals.\n      2. If the proposal does not comply with those requirements, the Commission may, at its discretion,\u2014\n        a: discontinue any consideration of the proposal; or\n        b: request the supplier to remedy the deficiencies in the proposal by providing additional information within 40\u00a0working days.\n      3. If the supplier fails to provide any additional information requested by the Commission under subsection (2)\ufeff(b), the Commission may discontinue any consideration of the proposal.\n      4. If a proposal is discontinued under subsection (2) or (3), section 53Q(3) does not apply and the supplier may make another proposal within the regulatory period (except in the 12\u00a0months before the default price-quality path is due to be reset).\n      -- Notes --\n      Section 53S: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n      -----------\n\n    53T: Process and timing for assessing proposal\n      1. Once the Commission decides that a proposal complies with the input methodologies relating to the process for, and content of, customised price-quality path proposals, it must\u2014\n        a: give notice that the proposal is under consideration, and how copies of the proposal may be obtained; and\n        b: set a date for interested persons to make submissions on the proposal; and\n        c: have regard to any submissions made by that date.\n      2. The Commission must make a determination on a proposal for a customised price-quality path within 150\u00a0working days of receiving a complete proposal, subject to sections 53U and 53Z.\n      -- Notes --\n      Section 53T: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n      -----------\n\n    53U: Extension of time frames\nThe time frames specified in sections 53S and 53T may, with the agreement of the supplier and the Commission, each be extended by a total of up to 30\u00a0working days.\n      -- Notes --\n      Section 53U: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n      -----------\n\n    53V: Determination setting customised price-quality path\n      1. The Commission may determine any customised price-quality path that the Commission considers appropriate for a supplier that has made a proposal.\n      2. To avoid doubt, and without limitation, in determining a customised price-quality path that complies with section 53M the Commission may do any of the following:\n        a: set a price-quality path that is lower, or otherwise less favourable to the regulated supplier, than the default price-quality path that would otherwise apply:\n        b: if it sets a lower or a higher price than applied under the default price-quality path, apply claw-back:\n        c: with the agreement of the supplier, vary an input methodology that would otherwise apply to the supplier.\n      3. A customised price-quality path for a supplier is imposed by way of an amendment to the section 52P determination relating to the default/customised price-quality regulation applying to the supplier.\n      -- Notes --\n      Section 53V: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n      -----------\n\n    53W: Term of customised price-quality paths\n      1. A customised price-quality path applies for 5\u00a0years.\n      2. However, the Commission may set a shorter period than 5\u00a0years if it considers this would better meet the purpose of this Part, but in any event may not set a term less than 3\u00a0years.\n      -- Notes --\n      Section 53W: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n      -----------\n\n    53X: What happens when customised price-quality path ends\n      1. When the customised price-quality path of a supplier of goods or services ends, the supplier is subject to the default price-quality path that is generally applicable to other suppliers of those goods or services.\n      2. The starting prices that apply at the beginning of the default price-quality path are those that applied at the end of the customised price-quality path unless, at least 4\u00a0months before the end of the customised price-quality path, the Commission advises the supplier that different starting prices must apply.\n      3. The supplier remains subject to the default price-quality path until\u2014\n        a: the end of the period for which it applies to other suppliers; or\n        b: a new customised price-quality path begins to apply to the supplier.\n      4. To avoid doubt, a supplier who is or was subject to a customised price-quality path may apply in accordance with section 53Q for another customised price-quality path.\n      -- Notes --\n      Section 53X: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n      -----------\n\n    53Y: Commission's costs relating to assessing, setting, and reconsidering customised price-quality path\n      1. The Commission\u2019s costs in assessing a proposal for, and setting or reconsidering, a customised price-quality path must be met by the person who makes the proposal for a customised price-quality path.\n      1A. If the amount paid by a person in respect of a proposal for a customised price-quality path exceeds the Commission's costs in assessing the proposal and (if applicable) setting or reconsidering the customised price-quality path, the Commission may refund the excess to the person who paid it.\n      2. The costs may be recovered in whatever manner the Commission determines.\n      -- Notes --\n      Section 53Y: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n      Section 53Y heading: amended, on 1\u00a0November 2010, by section 148(1) of the Electricity Industry Act 2010 (2010 No\u00a0116).\n      Section 53Y(1): amended, on 1\u00a0November 2010, by section 148(2) of the Electricity Industry Act 2010 (2010 No\u00a0116).\n      Section 53Y(1A): inserted, on 1\u00a0November 2010, by section 148(3) of the Electricity Industry Act 2010 (2010 No\u00a0116).\n      -----------\n\n    53Z: Prioritisation by Commission\n      1. The Commission is not required to consider any more than 4\u00a0proposals for a customised price-quality path relating to the same type of regulated goods or services in any one year.\n      2. If the Commission receives more than 4\u00a0proposals for a customised price-quality path relating to the same type of regulated goods or services in any one year, the Commission\u2014\n        a: may defer the additional proposals to a subsequent year; but\n        b: must prioritise its consideration of the proposals in accordance with the criteria in subsection (3).\n      3. The criteria for Commission decisions on priorities are as follows:\n        a: quality and completeness of the initial proposal:\n        b: urgency of any proposed additional investment (compared to historic rates of investment) required to meet consumer requirements on quality:\n        c: materiality of the proposal relative to the size and revenues of the supplier.\n      -- Notes --\n      Section 53Z: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n      -----------\n\n    53ZA: What happens if Commission does not make decision within time frame\n      1. This section applies if the Commission does not make a determination within 150\u00a0working days of receiving a complete proposal (or within any extended time agreed under section 53U).\n      2. If the regulated supplier has not complied, in the Commission\u2019s opinion, with any reasonable exercise by the Commission of its information-gathering powers under section 53ZD or 98, the default price-quality path continues in effect at the close of that period, and the Commission must notify the supplier accordingly.\n      3. If the regulated supplier has so complied, the customised proposal made under section 53Q takes effect at the close of that period.\n      4. If a customised price-quality path proposal takes effect under subsection (3), the Commission must immediately prepare an amendment to the relevant section 52P determination, setting out the customised price-quality path applying to the supplier.\n      -- Notes --\n      Section 53ZA: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n      -----------\n\n\n    # What happens to price-quality paths if input methodologies change\n\n    -- Notes --\n    Heading: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n    -----------\n\n    53ZB: What happens to price-quality paths if input methodologies change\n      1. Default or customised price-quality paths may not be reopened within a regulatory period on the grounds of a change in an input methodology, except as provided in subsection (2).\n      2. Every default and customised price-quality path must be reset by the Commission in accordance with section 53P if\u2014\n        a: an input methodology changes as a result of an appeal under section 52Z; and\n        b: had the changed methodology applied at the time the price-quality path was set, it would have resulted in a materially different path being set.\n      3. When resetting a default or customised price-quality path under subsection (2), the Commission must apply claw-back.\n      -- Notes --\n      Section 53ZB: inserted, on 14 October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n      -----------\n\n  Subpart 7: Individual price-quality regulation\n    -- Notes --\n    Subpart 7: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n    -----------\n\n    53ZC: Price-quality path for individual businesses\n      1. If individual price-quality regulation applies to goods or services supplied by a supplier, the Commission may set the price-quality path for that supplier using any process, and in any way, it thinks fit, but must use the input methodologies that apply to the supply of those goods or services.\n      2.

In this subpart, unless the context otherwise requires, a supplier is consumer-owned if it is a supplier that meets the following criteria:\n        a: all the control rights and all the equity return rights (within the meaning of clause 6 of Schedule\u00a02 of the Electricity Industry Act 2010) in the supplier are held by 1 or more customer trusts, community trusts, or customer co-operatives; and\n        b: the trustees of each customer trust or community trust, or the committee of shareholders of each customer co-operative, as the case may be, that is referred to in paragraph (a) are elected by the persons who are consumers of the supplier in accordance with subsections (2A) to (2C); and\n        c: at least 90% of the persons who are consumers of the supplier as at an income distribution resolution date benefit from that income distribution; and\n        d: the supplier has fewer than 150 000\u00a0ICPs.\n      2. In this section, unless the context otherwise requires,\u2014\n        community trust, in relation to a supplier, is a trust in respect of which\u2014\n        a: at least 90%\u00a0of the income beneficiaries comprise persons who are a class or classes identified by reference to their domicile or location or operation within the geographic area or areas of operation of the supplier; and\n        b: at least 90%\u00a0of its income distributions are paid to those beneficiaries or for purposes related to that geographic area or areas\n        consumer has the same meaning as in section 2(1) of the Electricity Act 1992, and includes, for the purposes of references to the election of trustees in this section and section 54H, any person who is listed on an electoral roll as a resident of an address that consumes the electricity in question\n        customer co-operative, in relation to a supplier, means a co-operative company (as defined in section 2(1) of the Co-operative Companies Act 1996) that has the characteristics described in the definition of customer trust in this subsection, applied as if references to trusts were to co-operatives, references to income beneficiaries were to shareholders, and all other necessary modifications were made\n        customer trust, in relation to a supplier, means a trust in respect of which\u2014\n        a: at least 90%\u00a0of the income beneficiaries comprise persons who are a class or classes identified by reference to any of\u2014\n          i: the person's connection to the lines of the supplier:\n          ii: the person's receipt of electricity from the supplier:\n          iii: the person's liability for payment for supply of electricity from the supplier:\n          iv: the person's liability for payment for the connection to the lines of the supplier:\n          v: the person's liability for payment for line services supplied by the supplier; and\n        b: at least 90%\u00a0of its income distributions are paid to those beneficiaries\n        ICP means a point of connection on a local or an embedded network at which a retailer supplies electricity to a consumer\n        income distribution resolution date means the date that a supplier, or the trust or co-operative that owns a supplier, as the case may be, resolves to make an income distribution to beneficiaries.\n      2A. The requirements in respect of elections for the purposes of subsection (1)\ufeff(b) are as follows:\n        a: every trustee of the customer trust or community trust, or every member of the committee of shareholders of each customer co-operative, as the case may be, must have been elected solely by the persons who are consumers of the supplier; and\n        b: either\u2014\n          i: at least 90%\u00a0of the persons who are consumers of the supplier at the time of the election are eligible to vote in those elections; or\n          ii: in the case of a customer trust or community trust, there is ward-based voting that complies with the requirements of subsection (2B); and\n        c: each consumer must have an equal vote.\n      2B. The requirements for ward-based voting are as follows:\n        a: at least 90%\u00a0of the persons in a ward who are consumers of the supplier at the time of the election are eligible to vote in the election of all of the trustees of that ward; and\n        b: ward boundaries must provide for effective and fair representation of all consumers of the supplier, and in particular,\u2014\n          i: the proportion of consumers in relation to the number of trustees of the relevant trust must be approximately equal in each ward; and\n          ii: the wards must not be based on volume of electricity supplied; and\n        c: ward boundaries must be reviewed periodically (at intervals determined by the Commission) in consultation with all consumers of the supplier.\n      2C.

The Commerce Commission may require a supplier that claims to meet the criteria in this section to verify that claim by statutory declaration.\n      2E. The declaration must be made by the persons and in the form required by the Commerce Commission.\n      3. As soon as practicable after this subsection comes into force, the Minister must publish a notice in the Gazette stating the names of the suppliers that are consumer-owned as at that date.\n      4. The notice in subsection (3) is only for information purposes and has no legal effect.\n      -- Notes --\n      Section 54D: inserted, on 1\u00a0April 2009, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n      Section 54D(1)\ufeff(a): amended, on 1\u00a0November 2010, by section 151(1) of the Electricity Industry Act 2010 (2010 No\u00a0116).\n      Section 54D(1)\ufeff(b): substituted, on 1\u00a0November 2010, by section 151(2) of the Electricity Industry Act 2010 (2010 No\u00a0116).\n      Section 54D(2A): inserted, on 1\u00a0November 2010, by section 151(3) of the Electricity Industry Act 2010 (2010 No\u00a0116).\n      Section 54D(2B): inserted, on 1\u00a0November 2010, by section 151(3) of the Electricity Industry Act 2010 (2010 No\u00a0116).\n      Section 54D(2C): inserted, on 1\u00a0November 2010, by section 151(3) of the Electricity Industry Act 2010 (2010 No\u00a0116).\n      Section 54D(2D): inserted, on 1\u00a0November 2010, by section 151(3) of the Electricity Industry Act 2010 (2010 No\u00a0116).\n      Section 54D(2E): inserted, on 1\u00a0November 2010, by section 151(3) of the Electricity Industry Act 2010 (2010 No\u00a0116).\n      Section 54D(3): brought into force, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 2(1)\ufeff(b) of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n      -----------\n\n\n    # Imposition of regulation under this Part\n\n    -- Notes --\n    Heading: inserted, on 1\u00a0April 2009, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n    -----------\n\n    54E: Electricity lines services declared to be regulated\nElectricity lines services are regulated under this Part.\n      -- Notes --\n      Section 54E: inserted, on 1\u00a0April 2009, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n      -----------\n\n    54F: All electricity lines services are subject to information disclosure regulation\nAll electricity lines services are subject to information disclosure regulation under this Part.\n      -- Notes --\n      Section 54F: inserted, on 1\u00a0April 2009, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n      -----------\n\n    54G: Certain electricity lines services are also subject to default/customised price-quality regulation\n      1. All electricity lines services (other than those supplied by Transpower) are subject to default/customised price-quality regulation under this Part unless they are exempt.\n      2. All electricity lines services that are supplied by a supplier that is consumer-owned are exempt (unless an Order in Council has been made in respect of the service under section 54H).\n      -- Notes --\n      Section 54G: inserted, on 1\u00a0April 2009, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n      -----------\n\n    54H: How exempt status can be lost and default/customised price-quality regulation can be applied to consumer-owned suppliers\n      1. Electricity lines services that are supplied by a supplier that is consumer-owned cease to be exempt for the purpose of section 54G (and therefore become subject to default/customised price-quality regulation under this Part) if the Governor-General, by Order in Council, declares that this section applies.\n      2. The Minister may make a recommendation only if the Minister is satisfied that either\u2014\n        a: the Commission has advised the Minister that a supplier has ceased to be consumer-owned within the meaning of section 54D; or\n        b: the Commission has recommended to the Minister that the purpose of this Part would be better met if price-quality regulation were imposed on the supplier under this Part.\n      2A. A supplier must give notice in writing to the Commission within 10\u00a0working days after becoming aware that it has ceased to be consumer-owned.\n      3. The Commission may make a recommendation under subsection (2)\ufeff(b) only following consideration of a petition made by 1\u00a0or more of the following:\n        a: 15% of the persons who are domestic consumers of the supplier as at the date of the petition who are eligible to vote in elections for trustees of the customer trust or community trust, or for members of the committee of shareholders of the customer co-operative:\n        b: 20% of the persons who are domestic consumers of the supplier as at that date who are not eligible to vote in elections for trustees of the customer trust or community trust, or for members of the committee of shareholders of the customer co-operative:\n        c: 25% of the persons who are non-domestic consumers (either by number or by consumption of that class of consumer) of the supplier as at that date.\n      3A. In this section, domestic consumer has the same meaning as in section 5 of the Electricity Industry Act 2010.\n      4. If exact figures are not available as to the number of persons in a class referred to in subsection (3), the Commission may rely on any estimate that the Commission considers to be a reasonable estimate.\n      5. Petition means a petition to the Commission seeking the application of price-quality regulation to all or any of the electricity lines services of the relevant supplier, and that records the signatures of the signatories.\n      6. The Governor-General may, on the recommendation of the Minister, make an Order in Council in accordance with this section.\n      7.

Any breach of an administrative settlement with Transpower may be dealt with under Part 6 as if it were a breach of a customised price-quality path, despite anything in the terms of the settlement.\n      3. Before the expiry of the administrative settlement, the Commission must recommend to the Minister that an Order in Council be made under section 52N declaring that either\u2014\n        a: Transpower is subject to default/customised price-quality regulation under subpart 6; or\n        b: Transpower is subject to individual price-quality regulation under subpart 7.\n      4. Subpart 2, except the provisions relating to inquiries, applies to the process for imposing that regulation and making the section 52P determination.\n      5. If an Order in Council declares that Transpower is subject to default/customised price-quality regulation, the section 52P determination must set the price-quality path that applies for the regulatory period commencing with the date on which the Order in Council comes into force, using the process under section 53P for resetting default price-quality paths.\n      6.       \n [repealed] \n      -- Notes --\n      Section 54M: inserted, on 1\u00a0April 2009, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n      Section 54M(3)\ufeff(b): amended, on 1\u00a0November 2010, by section 153(1) of the Electricity Industry Act 2010 (2010 No\u00a0116).\n      Section 54M(6): repealed, on 1\u00a0November 2010, by section 153(2) of the Electricity Industry Act 2010 (2010 No\u00a0116).\n      -----------\n\n    54N: Breaches of thresholds and default price-quality paths before 1\u00a0April 2010\n      1.

The Commission must use the processes set out in section 53P in making the first section 52P determinations that set out how default price-quality regulation applies to suppliers of gas pipeline services as if 30\u00a0June 2010 were the end of the previous regulatory period.\n      2. However, if a supplier has increased its weighted average prices by more than the movement, or forecast movement, in the all groups index number of the Consumers Price Index in the period beginning 1\u00a0January 2008 and ending with the date that the determination is made, the Commission may apply claw-back to the extent of requiring the supplier to lower its prices in order to compensate consumers for some or all of any over-recovery of revenues that occurred during that period.\n      3. The Commission may set a default price-quality path in respect of suppliers of gas pipeline services even if all or any of the relevant input methodologies have not been determined.\n      4. If an input methodology is published after a section 52P determination referred to in subsection (1) is made, and if, had that methodology applied at the time the default price-quality paths were set as required by subsection (1), it would have resulted in a materially different path being set, then the Commission may reset the default price-quality paths and may apply claw-back, despite section 53ZB(1).\n      5. However, the Commission may not exercise its powers in subsection (4) later than 9\u00a0months after the date of publication of the input methodology.\n      -- Notes --\n      Section 55F: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n      Section 55F(2): amended, on 1\u00a0September 2022, by section 107(1) of the Data and Statistics Act 2022 (2022 No\u00a039).\n      -----------\n\n\n    # Services controlled by virtue of Commerce (Control of Natural Gas Services) Order 2005\n\n    -- Notes --\n    Heading: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n    -----------\n\n    55G: Existing order, authorisations, and undertakings continue to apply until 1\u00a0July 2012 (or earlier expiry)\n      1.

The order continues in force, despite the repeal of Part 4 (as it was before its repeal by the Commerce Amendment Act 2008), until the date on which the order expires or is revoked (the expiry date).\n      3. The enactment of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 does not limit or affect, before the expiry date, any of the following in respect of the gas pipeline services that are controlled by virtue of the order:\n        a: any authorisation made (including the ability to amend or revoke an authorisation), or any undertaking obtained or accepted, under Part 5 before 1\u00a0April 2009; or\n        b: the power of the Commission to obtain or accept any further undertakings under Part 5; or\n        c: any action that may be commenced or continued in respect of a breach of any authorisation or undertaking.\n      4. To avoid doubt, subsection (3) applies as if the provisions of Parts 4 to 6 had not been amended or repealed by the Commerce Amendment Act 2008.\n      5. However, any breach of the order after 1\u00a0April 2009 may be dealt with under Part 6 as if it were a breach of a customised price-quality path.\n      -- Notes --\n      Section 55G: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n      -----------\n\n    55H: How price-quality regulation under this Part applies after 1\u00a0July 2012 (or earlier expiry)\n      1.

Every price-quality path (whether a default price-quality path or a customised price-quality path under this subpart, or an individual price-quality path under subpart 7) must specify,\u2014\n        a: in relation to prices, either or both of the following with respect to a specified regulatory period:\n          i: the maximum price or prices that may be charged by a regulated supplier:\n          ii: the maximum revenues that may be recovered by a regulated supplier; and\n        b: the quality standards that must be met by the regulated supplier; and\n        c: the regulatory period.\n      2. A price-quality path may include incentives for an individual supplier to maintain or improve its quality of supply, and those incentives may include (without limitation) any of the following:\n        a: penalties by way of a reduction in the supplier's maximum prices or revenues based on whether, or by what amount, the supplier fails to meet the required quality standards:\n        b: rewards by way of an increase in the supplier's maximum prices or revenue based on whether, or by what amount, the supplier meets or exceeds the required quality standards:\n        c: consumer compensation schemes that set minimum standards of performance and require the supplier to pay prescribed amounts of compensation to consumers if it fails to meet those standards:\n        d: reporting requirements, including special reporting requirements in asset management plans, if the supplier fails to meet the quality standards.\n      3. Quality standards may be prescribed in any way the Commission considers appropriate (such as targets, bands, or formulae) and may include (without limitation)\u2014\n        a: responsiveness to consumers; and\n        b: in relation to electricity lines services, reliability of supply, reduction in energy losses, and voltage stability or other technical requirements.\n      4.

Before the end of the first and every subsequent regulatory period, the Commission must amend the section 52P determination by setting out the starting prices (as referred to in section 53O(a)), rates of change (as referred to in section 53O(b)), and quality standards (as referred to in section 53O(c)) that apply for the following regulatory period.\n      2. In resetting starting prices, rates of change, and quality standards, the Commission must consult with interested parties.\n      3. The starting prices must be either\u2014\n        a: the prices that applied at the end of the preceding regulatory period; or\n        b: prices, determined by the Commission, that are based on the current and projected profitability of each supplier.\n      4. Starting prices set in accordance with subsection (3)\ufeff(b) must not seek to recover any excessive profits made during any earlier period.\n      5. Subject to subsection (8), the Commission must set only 1\u00a0rate of change per type of regulated goods or services (for example, if the rate of change (x) is 1% in a CPI\u2212x path, 1% must be the rate for all goods or services of that type).\n      6. The rate of change must be based on the long-run average productivity improvement rate achieved by either or both of suppliers in New Zealand, and suppliers in other comparable countries, of the relevant goods or services, using whatever measures of productivity the Commission considers appropriate.\n      7. When setting the rate of change, the Commission may take into account the effects of inflation on the inputs of suppliers of the relevant goods or services.\n      8. The Commission may set alternative rates of change for a particular supplier\u2014\n        a: as an alternative, in whole or in part, to the starting prices set under subsection (3)\ufeff(b) if, in the Commission's opinion, this is necessary or desirable to minimise any undue financial hardship to the supplier or to minimise price shock to consumers; or\n        b: as an incentive (under section 53M(2)) for the supplier to improve its quality of supply.\n      9. Any alternative rates of change set under subsection (8) may include step changes.\n      10. The Commission may not, for the purposes of this section, use comparative benchmarking on efficiency in order to set starting prices, rates of change, quality standards, or incentives to improve quality of supply.\n      11. If starting prices, rates of change, and quality standards have not been set by way of an amendment to the relevant section 52P determination by the end of the regulatory period to which it applies, the starting prices, rates of change, and quality standards that apply at the end of the regulatory period continue to apply until the reset starting prices, rates of change, and quality standards are set.\n      -- Notes --\n      Section 53P: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n      -----------\n\n\n    # Customised price-quality paths\n\n    -- Notes --\n    Heading: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n    -----------\n\n    53Q: Supplier may propose customised price-quality path\n      1. At any time after a default price-quality path is set by the Commission, a supplier that is (or is likely to be) subject to the default price-quality path may make a proposal to the Commission for a customised price-quality path to apply to that supplier.\n      2. Every proposal must\u2014\n        a: comply with the input methodologies referred to in section 52T(1)\ufeff(d) relating to the process for, and content of, customised price-quality path proposals; and\n        b: be made within the period, or by the annual date, specified for the purpose in the section 52P determination; and\n        c: include the standard application fee for customised price-quality path proposals; and\n        d: apply or adopt all relevant input methodologies.\n      3. A supplier may make only 1 proposal during a regulatory period, and may not make a proposal within the 12\u00a0months before a default price-quality path is due to be reset.\n      4. A supplier that makes a proposal must make it publicly available as soon as practicable after it has been made to the Commission.\n      -- Notes --\n      Section 53Q: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n      -----------\n\n    53R: Effect of making proposal for customised price-quality path\nA supplier that makes a proposal to the Commission\u2014\n      a: cannot withdraw the proposal; and\n      b: is bound, for the regulatory period to which it applies, by any customised price-quality path that the Commission subsequently sets for the supplier.\n      -- Notes --\n      Section 53R: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n      -----------\n\n    53S: Preliminary assessment of proposal\n      1. Within 40 working days after receiving a proposal, the Commission must determine whether the proposal complies with the input methodologies referred to in section 52T(1)\ufeff(d) relating to the process for, and content of, customised price-quality path proposals.\n      2. If the proposal does not comply with those requirements, the Commission may, at its discretion,\u2014\n        a: discontinue any consideration of the proposal; or\n        b: request the supplier to remedy the deficiencies in the proposal by providing additional information within 40\u00a0working days.\n      3. If the supplier fails to provide any additional information requested by the Commission under subsection (2)\ufeff(b), the Commission may discontinue any consideration of the proposal.\n      4. If a proposal is discontinued under subsection (2) or (3), section 53Q(3) does not apply and the supplier may make another proposal within the regulatory period (except in the 12\u00a0months before the default price-quality path is due to be reset).\n      -- Notes --\n      Section 53S: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n      -----------\n\n    53T: Process and timing for assessing proposal\n      1. Once the Commission decides that a proposal complies with the input methodologies relating to the process for, and content of, customised price-quality path proposals, it must\u2014\n        a: give notice that the proposal is under consideration, and how copies of the proposal may be obtained; and\n        b: set a date for interested persons to make submissions on the proposal; and\n        c: have regard to any submissions made by that date.\n      2. The Commission must make a determination on a proposal for a customised price-quality path within 150\u00a0working days of receiving a complete proposal, subject to sections 53U and 53Z.\n      -- Notes --\n      Section 53T: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n      -----------\n\n    53U: Extension of time frames\nThe time frames specified in sections 53S and 53T may, with the agreement of the supplier and the Commission, each be extended by a total of up to 30\u00a0working days.\n      -- Notes --\n      Section 53U: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n      -----------\n\n    53V: Determination setting customised price-quality path\n      1. The Commission may determine any customised price-quality path that the Commission considers appropriate for a supplier that has made a proposal.\n      2. To avoid doubt, and without limitation, in determining a customised price-quality path that complies with section 53M the Commission may do any of the following:\n        a: set a price-quality path that is lower, or otherwise less favourable to the regulated supplier, than the default price-quality path that would otherwise apply:\n        b: if it sets a lower or a higher price than applied under the default price-quality path, apply claw-back:\n        c: with the agreement of the supplier, vary an input methodology that would otherwise apply to the supplier.\n      3. A customised price-quality path for a supplier is imposed by way of an amendment to the section 52P determination relating to the default/customised price-quality regulation applying to the supplier.\n      -- Notes --\n      Section 53V: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n      -----------\n\n    53W: Term of customised price-quality paths\n      1. A customised price-quality path applies for 5\u00a0years.\n      2. However, the Commission may set a shorter period than 5\u00a0years if it considers this would better meet the purpose of this Part, but in any event may not set a term less than 3\u00a0years.\n      -- Notes --\n      Section 53W: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n      -----------\n\n    53X: What happens when customised price-quality path ends\n      1. When the customised price-quality path of a supplier of goods or services ends, the supplier is subject to the default price-quality path that is generally applicable to other suppliers of those goods or services.\n      2. The starting prices that apply at the beginning of the default price-quality path are those that applied at the end of the customised price-quality path unless, at least 4\u00a0months before the end of the customised price-quality path, the Commission advises the supplier that different starting prices must apply.\n      3. The supplier remains subject to the default price-quality path until\u2014\n        a: the end of the period for which it applies to other suppliers; or\n        b: a new customised price-quality path begins to apply to the supplier.\n      4. To avoid doubt, a supplier who is or was subject to a customised price-quality path may apply in accordance with section 53Q for another customised price-quality path.\n      -- Notes --\n      Section 53X: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n      -----------\n\n    53Y: Commission's costs relating to assessing, setting, and reconsidering customised price-quality path\n      1. The Commission\u2019s costs in assessing a proposal for, and setting or reconsidering, a customised price-quality path must be met by the person who makes the proposal for a customised price-quality path.\n      1A. If the amount paid by a person in respect of a proposal for a customised price-quality path exceeds the Commission's costs in assessing the proposal and (if applicable) setting or reconsidering the customised price-quality path, the Commission may refund the excess to the person who paid it.\n      2. The costs may be recovered in whatever manner the Commission determines.\n      -- Notes --\n      Section 53Y: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n      Section 53Y heading: amended, on 1\u00a0November 2010, by section 148(1) of the Electricity Industry Act 2010 (2010 No\u00a0116).\n      Section 53Y(1): amended, on 1\u00a0November 2010, by section 148(2) of the Electricity Industry Act 2010 (2010 No\u00a0116).\n      Section 53Y(1A): inserted, on 1\u00a0November 2010, by section 148(3) of the Electricity Industry Act 2010 (2010 No\u00a0116).\n      -----------\n\n    53Z: Prioritisation by Commission\n      1. The Commission is not required to consider any more than 4\u00a0proposals for a customised price-quality path relating to the same type of regulated goods or services in any one year.\n      2. If the Commission receives more than 4\u00a0proposals for a customised price-quality path relating to the same type of regulated goods or services in any one year, the Commission\u2014\n        a: may defer the additional proposals to a subsequent year; but\n        b: must prioritise its consideration of the proposals in accordance with the criteria in subsection (3).\n      3. The criteria for Commission decisions on priorities are as follows:\n        a: quality and completeness of the initial proposal:\n        b: urgency of any proposed additional investment (compared to historic rates of investment) required to meet consumer requirements on quality:\n        c: materiality of the proposal relative to the size and revenues of the supplier.\n      -- Notes --\n      Section 53Z: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n      -----------\n\n    53ZA: What happens if Commission does not make decision within time frame\n      1. This section applies if the Commission does not make a determination within 150\u00a0working days of receiving a complete proposal (or within any extended time agreed under section 53U).\n      2. If the regulated supplier has not complied, in the Commission\u2019s opinion, with any reasonable exercise by the Commission of its information-gathering powers under section 53ZD or 98, the default price-quality path continues in effect at the close of that period, and the Commission must notify the supplier accordingly.\n      3. If the regulated supplier has so complied, the customised proposal made under section 53Q takes effect at the close of that period.\n      4. If a customised price-quality path proposal takes effect under subsection (3), the Commission must immediately prepare an amendment to the relevant section 52P determination, setting out the customised price-quality path applying to the supplier.\n      -- Notes --\n      Section 53ZA: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n      -----------\n\n\n    # What happens to price-quality paths if input methodologies change\n\n    -- Notes --\n    Heading: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n    -----------\n\n    53ZB: What happens to price-quality paths if input methodologies change\n      1. Default or customised price-quality paths may not be reopened within a regulatory period on the grounds of a change in an input methodology, except as provided in subsection (2).\n      2. Every default and customised price-quality path must be reset by the Commission in accordance with section 53P if\u2014\n        a: an input methodology changes as a result of an appeal under section 52Z; and\n        b: had the changed methodology applied at the time the price-quality path was set, it would have resulted in a materially different path being set.\n      3. When resetting a default or customised price-quality path under subsection (2), the Commission must apply claw-back.\n      -- Notes --\n      Section 53ZB: inserted, on 14 October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n      -----------\n\n  Subpart 7: Individual price-quality regulation\n    -- Notes --\n    Subpart 7: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n    -----------\n\n    53ZC: Price-quality path for individual businesses\n      1. If individual price-quality regulation applies to goods or services supplied by a supplier, the Commission may set the price-quality path for that supplier using any process, and in any way, it thinks fit, but must use the input methodologies that apply to the supply of those goods or services.\n      2.

In this subpart, unless the context otherwise requires, a supplier is consumer-owned if it is a supplier that meets the following criteria:\n        a: all the control rights and all the equity return rights (within the meaning of clause 6 of Schedule\u00a02 of the Electricity Industry Act 2010) in the supplier are held by 1 or more customer trusts, community trusts, or customer co-operatives; and\n        b: the trustees of each customer trust or community trust, or the committee of shareholders of each customer co-operative, as the case may be, that is referred to in paragraph (a) are elected by the persons who are consumers of the supplier in accordance with subsections (2A) to (2C); and\n        c: at least 90% of the persons who are consumers of the supplier as at an income distribution resolution date benefit from that income distribution; and\n        d: the supplier has fewer than 150 000\u00a0ICPs.\n      2. In this section, unless the context otherwise requires,\u2014\n        community trust, in relation to a supplier, is a trust in respect of which\u2014\n        a: at least 90%\u00a0of the income beneficiaries comprise persons who are a class or classes identified by reference to their domicile or location or operation within the geographic area or areas of operation of the supplier; and\n        b: at least 90%\u00a0of its income distributions are paid to those beneficiaries or for purposes related to that geographic area or areas\n        consumer has the same meaning as in section 2(1) of the Electricity Act 1992, and includes, for the purposes of references to the election of trustees in this section and section 54H, any person who is listed on an electoral roll as a resident of an address that consumes the electricity in question\n        customer co-operative, in relation to a supplier, means a co-operative company (as defined in section 2(1) of the Co-operative Companies Act 1996) that has the characteristics described in the definition of customer trust in this subsection, applied as if references to trusts were to co-operatives, references to income beneficiaries were to shareholders, and all other necessary modifications were made\n        customer trust, in relation to a supplier, means a trust in respect of which\u2014\n        a: at least 90%\u00a0of the income beneficiaries comprise persons who are a class or classes identified by reference to any of\u2014\n          i: the person's connection to the lines of the supplier:\n          ii: the person's receipt of electricity from the supplier:\n          iii: the person's liability for payment for supply of electricity from the supplier:\n          iv: the person's liability for payment for the connection to the lines of the supplier:\n          v: the person's liability for payment for line services supplied by the supplier; and\n        b: at least 90%\u00a0of its income distributions are paid to those beneficiaries\n        ICP means a point of connection on a local or an embedded network at which a retailer supplies electricity to a consumer\n        income distribution resolution date means the date that a supplier, or the trust or co-operative that owns a supplier, as the case may be, resolves to make an income distribution to beneficiaries.\n      2A. The requirements in respect of elections for the purposes of subsection (1)\ufeff(b) are as follows:\n        a: every trustee of the customer trust or community trust, or every member of the committee of shareholders of each customer co-operative, as the case may be, must have been elected solely by the persons who are consumers of the supplier; and\n        b: either\u2014\n          i: at least 90%\u00a0of the persons who are consumers of the supplier at the time of the election are eligible to vote in those elections; or\n          ii: in the case of a customer trust or community trust, there is ward-based voting that complies with the requirements of subsection (2B); and\n        c: each consumer must have an equal vote.\n      2B. The requirements for ward-based voting are as follows:\n        a: at least 90%\u00a0of the persons in a ward who are consumers of the supplier at the time of the election are eligible to vote in the election of all of the trustees of that ward; and\n        b: ward boundaries must provide for effective and fair representation of all consumers of the supplier, and in particular,\u2014\n          i: the proportion of consumers in relation to the number of trustees of the relevant trust must be approximately equal in each ward; and\n          ii: the wards must not be based on volume of electricity supplied; and\n        c: ward boundaries must be reviewed periodically (at intervals determined by the Commission) in consultation with all consumers of the supplier.\n      2C.

The Commerce Commission may require a supplier that claims to meet the criteria in this section to verify that claim by statutory declaration.\n      2E. The declaration must be made by the persons and in the form required by the Commerce Commission.\n      3. As soon as practicable after this subsection comes into force, the Minister must publish a notice in the Gazette stating the names of the suppliers that are consumer-owned as at that date.\n      4. The notice in subsection (3) is only for information purposes and has no legal effect.\n      -- Notes --\n      Section 54D: inserted, on 1\u00a0April 2009, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n      Section 54D(1)\ufeff(a): amended, on 1\u00a0November 2010, by section 151(1) of the Electricity Industry Act 2010 (2010 No\u00a0116).\n      Section 54D(1)\ufeff(b): substituted, on 1\u00a0November 2010, by section 151(2) of the Electricity Industry Act 2010 (2010 No\u00a0116).\n      Section 54D(2A): inserted, on 1\u00a0November 2010, by section 151(3) of the Electricity Industry Act 2010 (2010 No\u00a0116).\n      Section 54D(2B): inserted, on 1\u00a0November 2010, by section 151(3) of the Electricity Industry Act 2010 (2010 No\u00a0116).\n      Section 54D(2C): inserted, on 1\u00a0November 2010, by section 151(3) of the Electricity Industry Act 2010 (2010 No\u00a0116).\n      Section 54D(2D): inserted, on 1\u00a0November 2010, by section 151(3) of the Electricity Industry Act 2010 (2010 No\u00a0116).\n      Section 54D(2E): inserted, on 1\u00a0November 2010, by section 151(3) of the Electricity Industry Act 2010 (2010 No\u00a0116).\n      Section 54D(3): brought into force, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 2(1)\ufeff(b) of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n      -----------\n\n\n    # Imposition of regulation under this Part\n\n    -- Notes --\n    Heading: inserted, on 1\u00a0April 2009, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n    -----------\n\n    54E: Electricity lines services declared to be regulated\nElectricity lines services are regulated under this Part.\n      -- Notes --\n      Section 54E: inserted, on 1\u00a0April 2009, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n      -----------\n\n    54F: All electricity lines services are subject to information disclosure regulation\nAll electricity lines services are subject to information disclosure regulation under this Part.\n      -- Notes --\n      Section 54F: inserted, on 1\u00a0April 2009, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n      -----------\n\n    54G: Certain electricity lines services are also subject to default/customised price-quality regulation\n      1. All electricity lines services (other than those supplied by Transpower) are subject to default/customised price-quality regulation under this Part unless they are exempt.\n      2. All electricity lines services that are supplied by a supplier that is consumer-owned are exempt (unless an Order in Council has been made in respect of the service under section 54H).\n      -- Notes --\n      Section 54G: inserted, on 1\u00a0April 2009, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n      -----------\n\n    54H: How exempt status can be lost and default/customised price-quality regulation can be applied to consumer-owned suppliers\n      1. Electricity lines services that are supplied by a supplier that is consumer-owned cease to be exempt for the purpose of section 54G (and therefore become subject to default/customised price-quality regulation under this Part) if the Governor-General, by Order in Council, declares that this section applies.\n      2. The Minister may make a recommendation only if the Minister is satisfied that either\u2014\n        a: the Commission has advised the Minister that a supplier has ceased to be consumer-owned within the meaning of section 54D; or\n        b: the Commission has recommended to the Minister that the purpose of this Part would be better met if price-quality regulation were imposed on the supplier under this Part.\n      2A. A supplier must give notice in writing to the Commission within 10\u00a0working days after becoming aware that it has ceased to be consumer-owned.\n      3. The Commission may make a recommendation under subsection (2)\ufeff(b) only following consideration of a petition made by 1\u00a0or more of the following:\n        a: 15% of the persons who are domestic consumers of the supplier as at the date of the petition who are eligible to vote in elections for trustees of the customer trust or community trust, or for members of the committee of shareholders of the customer co-operative:\n        b: 20% of the persons who are domestic consumers of the supplier as at that date who are not eligible to vote in elections for trustees of the customer trust or community trust, or for members of the committee of shareholders of the customer co-operative:\n        c: 25% of the persons who are non-domestic consumers (either by number or by consumption of that class of consumer) of the supplier as at that date.\n      3A. In this section, domestic consumer has the same meaning as in section 5 of the Electricity Industry Act 2010.\n      4. If exact figures are not available as to the number of persons in a class referred to in subsection (3), the Commission may rely on any estimate that the Commission considers to be a reasonable estimate.\n      5. Petition means a petition to the Commission seeking the application of price-quality regulation to all or any of the electricity lines services of the relevant supplier, and that records the signatures of the signatories.\n      6. The Governor-General may, on the recommendation of the Minister, make an Order in Council in accordance with this section.\n      7.

Any breach of an administrative settlement with Transpower may be dealt with under Part 6 as if it were a breach of a customised price-quality path, despite anything in the terms of the settlement.\n      3. Before the expiry of the administrative settlement, the Commission must recommend to the Minister that an Order in Council be made under section 52N declaring that either\u2014\n        a: Transpower is subject to default/customised price-quality regulation under subpart 6; or\n        b: Transpower is subject to individual price-quality regulation under subpart 7.\n      4. Subpart 2, except the provisions relating to inquiries, applies to the process for imposing that regulation and making the section 52P determination.\n      5. If an Order in Council declares that Transpower is subject to default/customised price-quality regulation, the section 52P determination must set the price-quality path that applies for the regulatory period commencing with the date on which the Order in Council comes into force, using the process under section 53P for resetting default price-quality paths.\n      6.       \n [repealed] \n      -- Notes --\n      Section 54M: inserted, on 1\u00a0April 2009, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n      Section 54M(3)\ufeff(b): amended, on 1\u00a0November 2010, by section 153(1) of the Electricity Industry Act 2010 (2010 No\u00a0116).\n      Section 54M(6): repealed, on 1\u00a0November 2010, by section 153(2) of the Electricity Industry Act 2010 (2010 No\u00a0116).\n      -----------\n\n    54N: Breaches of thresholds and default price-quality paths before 1\u00a0April 2010\n      1.

The Commission must use the processes set out in section 53P in making the first section 52P determinations that set out how default price-quality regulation applies to suppliers of gas pipeline services as if 30\u00a0June 2010 were the end of the previous regulatory period.\n      2. However, if a supplier has increased its weighted average prices by more than the movement, or forecast movement, in the all groups index number of the Consumers Price Index in the period beginning 1\u00a0January 2008 and ending with the date that the determination is made, the Commission may apply claw-back to the extent of requiring the supplier to lower its prices in order to compensate consumers for some or all of any over-recovery of revenues that occurred during that period.\n      3. The Commission may set a default price-quality path in respect of suppliers of gas pipeline services even if all or any of the relevant input methodologies have not been determined.\n      4. If an input methodology is published after a section 52P determination referred to in subsection (1) is made, and if, had that methodology applied at the time the default price-quality paths were set as required by subsection (1), it would have resulted in a materially different path being set, then the Commission may reset the default price-quality paths and may apply claw-back, despite section 53ZB(1).\n      5. However, the Commission may not exercise its powers in subsection (4) later than 9\u00a0months after the date of publication of the input methodology.\n      -- Notes --\n      Section 55F: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n      Section 55F(2): amended, on 1\u00a0September 2022, by section 107(1) of the Data and Statistics Act 2022 (2022 No\u00a039).\n      -----------\n\n\n    # Services controlled by virtue of Commerce (Control of Natural Gas Services) Order 2005\n\n    -- Notes --\n    Heading: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n    -----------\n\n    55G: Existing order, authorisations, and undertakings continue to apply until 1\u00a0July 2012 (or earlier expiry)\n      1.

The order continues in force, despite the repeal of Part 4 (as it was before its repeal by the Commerce Amendment Act 2008), until the date on which the order expires or is revoked (the expiry date).\n      3. The enactment of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 does not limit or affect, before the expiry date, any of the following in respect of the gas pipeline services that are controlled by virtue of the order:\n        a: any authorisation made (including the ability to amend or revoke an authorisation), or any undertaking obtained or accepted, under Part 5 before 1\u00a0April 2009; or\n        b: the power of the Commission to obtain or accept any further undertakings under Part 5; or\n        c: any action that may be commenced or continued in respect of a breach of any authorisation or undertaking.\n      4. To avoid doubt, subsection (3) applies as if the provisions of Parts 4 to 6 had not been amended or repealed by the Commerce Amendment Act 2008.\n      5. However, any breach of the order after 1\u00a0April 2009 may be dealt with under Part 6 as if it were a breach of a customised price-quality path.\n      -- Notes --\n      Section 55G: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n      -----------\n\n    55H: How price-quality regulation under this Part applies after 1\u00a0July 2012 (or earlier expiry)\n      1.

Every price-quality path (whether a default price-quality path or a customised price-quality path under this subpart, or an individual price-quality path under subpart 7) must specify,\u2014\n      a: in relation to prices, either or both of the following with respect to a specified regulatory period:\n        i: the maximum price or prices that may be charged by a regulated supplier:\n        ii: the maximum revenues that may be recovered by a regulated supplier; and\n      b: the quality standards that must be met by the regulated supplier; and\n      c: the regulatory period.\n    2. A price-quality path may include incentives for an individual supplier to maintain or improve its quality of supply, and those incentives may include (without limitation) any of the following:\n      a: penalties by way of a reduction in the supplier's maximum prices or revenues based on whether, or by what amount, the supplier fails to meet the required quality standards:\n      b: rewards by way of an increase in the supplier's maximum prices or revenue based on whether, or by what amount, the supplier meets or exceeds the required quality standards:\n      c: consumer compensation schemes that set minimum standards of performance and require the supplier to pay prescribed amounts of compensation to consumers if it fails to meet those standards:\n      d: reporting requirements, including special reporting requirements in asset management plans, if the supplier fails to meet the quality standards.\n    3. Quality standards may be prescribed in any way the Commission considers appropriate (such as targets, bands, or formulae) and may include (without limitation)\u2014\n      a: responsiveness to consumers; and\n      b: in relation to electricity lines services, reliability of supply, reduction in energy losses, and voltage stability or other technical requirements.\n    4.

Before the end of the first and every subsequent regulatory period, the Commission must amend the section 52P determination by setting out the starting prices (as referred to in section 53O(a)), rates of change (as referred to in section 53O(b)), and quality standards (as referred to in section 53O(c)) that apply for the following regulatory period.\n    2. In resetting starting prices, rates of change, and quality standards, the Commission must consult with interested parties.\n    3. The starting prices must be either\u2014\n      a: the prices that applied at the end of the preceding regulatory period; or\n      b: prices, determined by the Commission, that are based on the current and projected profitability of each supplier.\n    4. Starting prices set in accordance with subsection (3)\ufeff(b) must not seek to recover any excessive profits made during any earlier period.\n    5. Subject to subsection (8), the Commission must set only 1\u00a0rate of change per type of regulated goods or services (for example, if the rate of change (x) is 1% in a CPI\u2212x path, 1% must be the rate for all goods or services of that type).\n    6. The rate of change must be based on the long-run average productivity improvement rate achieved by either or both of suppliers in New Zealand, and suppliers in other comparable countries, of the relevant goods or services, using whatever measures of productivity the Commission considers appropriate.\n    7. When setting the rate of change, the Commission may take into account the effects of inflation on the inputs of suppliers of the relevant goods or services.\n    8. The Commission may set alternative rates of change for a particular supplier\u2014\n      a: as an alternative, in whole or in part, to the starting prices set under subsection (3)\ufeff(b) if, in the Commission's opinion, this is necessary or desirable to minimise any undue financial hardship to the supplier or to minimise price shock to consumers; or\n      b: as an incentive (under section 53M(2)) for the supplier to improve its quality of supply.\n    9. Any alternative rates of change set under subsection (8) may include step changes.\n    10. The Commission may not, for the purposes of this section, use comparative benchmarking on efficiency in order to set starting prices, rates of change, quality standards, or incentives to improve quality of supply.\n    11. If starting prices, rates of change, and quality standards have not been set by way of an amendment to the relevant section 52P determination by the end of the regulatory period to which it applies, the starting prices, rates of change, and quality standards that apply at the end of the regulatory period continue to apply until the reset starting prices, rates of change, and quality standards are set.\n    -- Notes --\n    Section 53P: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n    -----------\n\n\n  # Customised price-quality paths\n\n  -- Notes --\n  Heading: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n  -----------\n\n  53Q: Supplier may propose customised price-quality path\n    1.

A supplier may make only 1 proposal during a regulatory period, and may not make a proposal within the 12\u00a0months before a default price-quality path is due to be reset.\n    4.

Within 40 working days after receiving a proposal, the Commission must determine whether the proposal complies with the input methodologies referred to in section 52T(1)\ufeff(d) relating to the process for, and content of, customised price-quality path proposals.\n    2. If the proposal does not comply with those requirements, the Commission may, at its discretion,\u2014\n      a: discontinue any consideration of the proposal; or\n      b: request the supplier to remedy the deficiencies in the proposal by providing additional information within 40\u00a0working days.\n    3. If the supplier fails to provide any additional information requested by the Commission under subsection (2)\ufeff(b), the Commission may discontinue any consideration of the proposal.\n    4. If a proposal is discontinued under subsection (2) or (3), section 53Q(3) does not apply and the supplier may make another proposal within the regulatory period (except in the 12\u00a0months before the default price-quality path is due to be reset).\n    -- Notes --\n    Section 53S: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n    -----------\n\n  53T: Process and timing for assessing proposal\n    1. Once the Commission decides that a proposal complies with the input methodologies relating to the process for, and content of, customised price-quality path proposals, it must\u2014\n      a: give notice that the proposal is under consideration, and how copies of the proposal may be obtained; and\n      b: set a date for interested persons to make submissions on the proposal; and\n      c: have regard to any submissions made by that date.\n    2. The Commission must make a determination on a proposal for a customised price-quality path within 150\u00a0working days of receiving a complete proposal, subject to sections 53U and 53Z.\n    -- Notes --\n    Section 53T: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n    -----------\n\n  53U: Extension of time frames\nThe time frames specified in sections 53S and 53T may, with the agreement of the supplier and the Commission, each be extended by a total of up to 30\u00a0working days.\n    -- Notes --\n    Section 53U: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n    -----------\n\n  53V: Determination setting customised price-quality path\n    1. The Commission may determine any customised price-quality path that the Commission considers appropriate for a supplier that has made a proposal.\n    2. To avoid doubt, and without limitation, in determining a customised price-quality path that complies with section 53M the Commission may do any of the following:\n      a: set a price-quality path that is lower, or otherwise less favourable to the regulated supplier, than the default price-quality path that would otherwise apply:\n      b: if it sets a lower or a higher price than applied under the default price-quality path, apply claw-back:\n      c: with the agreement of the supplier, vary an input methodology that would otherwise apply to the supplier.\n    3. A customised price-quality path for a supplier is imposed by way of an amendment to the section 52P determination relating to the default/customised price-quality regulation applying to the supplier.\n    -- Notes --\n    Section 53V: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n    -----------\n\n  53W: Term of customised price-quality paths\n    1. A customised price-quality path applies for 5\u00a0years.\n    2. However, the Commission may set a shorter period than 5\u00a0years if it considers this would better meet the purpose of this Part, but in any event may not set a term less than 3\u00a0years.\n    -- Notes --\n    Section 53W: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n    -----------\n\n  53X: What happens when customised price-quality path ends\n    1. When the customised price-quality path of a supplier of goods or services ends, the supplier is subject to the default price-quality path that is generally applicable to other suppliers of those goods or services.\n    2. The starting prices that apply at the beginning of the default price-quality path are those that applied at the end of the customised price-quality path unless, at least 4\u00a0months before the end of the customised price-quality path, the Commission advises the supplier that different starting prices must apply.\n    3. The supplier remains subject to the default price-quality path until\u2014\n      a: the end of the period for which it applies to other suppliers; or\n      b: a new customised price-quality path begins to apply to the supplier.\n    4. To avoid doubt, a supplier who is or was subject to a customised price-quality path may apply in accordance with section 53Q for another customised price-quality path.\n    -- Notes --\n    Section 53X: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n    -----------\n\n  53Y: Commission's costs relating to assessing, setting, and reconsidering customised price-quality path\n    1. The Commission\u2019s costs in assessing a proposal for, and setting or reconsidering, a customised price-quality path must be met by the person who makes the proposal for a customised price-quality path.\n    1A. If the amount paid by a person in respect of a proposal for a customised price-quality path exceeds the Commission's costs in assessing the proposal and (if applicable) setting or reconsidering the customised price-quality path, the Commission may refund the excess to the person who paid it.\n    2. The costs may be recovered in whatever manner the Commission determines.\n    -- Notes --\n    Section 53Y: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n    Section 53Y heading: amended, on 1\u00a0November 2010, by section 148(1) of the Electricity Industry Act 2010 (2010 No\u00a0116).\n    Section 53Y(1): amended, on 1\u00a0November 2010, by section 148(2) of the Electricity Industry Act 2010 (2010 No\u00a0116).\n    Section 53Y(1A): inserted, on 1\u00a0November 2010, by section 148(3) of the Electricity Industry Act 2010 (2010 No\u00a0116).\n    -----------\n\n  53Z: Prioritisation by Commission\n    1. The Commission is not required to consider any more than 4\u00a0proposals for a customised price-quality path relating to the same type of regulated goods or services in any one year.\n    2. If the Commission receives more than 4\u00a0proposals for a customised price-quality path relating to the same type of regulated goods or services in any one year, the Commission\u2014\n      a: may defer the additional proposals to a subsequent year; but\n      b: must prioritise its consideration of the proposals in accordance with the criteria in subsection (3).\n    3. The criteria for Commission decisions on priorities are as follows:\n      a: quality and completeness of the initial proposal:\n      b: urgency of any proposed additional investment (compared to historic rates of investment) required to meet consumer requirements on quality:\n      c: materiality of the proposal relative to the size and revenues of the supplier.\n    -- Notes --\n    Section 53Z: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n    -----------\n\n  53ZA: What happens if Commission does not make decision within time frame\n    1. This section applies if the Commission does not make a determination within 150\u00a0working days of receiving a complete proposal (or within any extended time agreed under section 53U).\n    2. If the regulated supplier has not complied, in the Commission\u2019s opinion, with any reasonable exercise by the Commission of its information-gathering powers under section 53ZD or 98, the default price-quality path continues in effect at the close of that period, and the Commission must notify the supplier accordingly.\n    3. If the regulated supplier has so complied, the customised proposal made under section 53Q takes effect at the close of that period.\n    4. If a customised price-quality path proposal takes effect under subsection (3), the Commission must immediately prepare an amendment to the relevant section 52P determination, setting out the customised price-quality path applying to the supplier.\n    -- Notes --\n    Section 53ZA: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n    -----------\n\n\n  # What happens to price-quality paths if input methodologies change\n\n  -- Notes --\n  Heading: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n  -----------\n\n  53ZB: What happens to price-quality paths if input methodologies change\n    1. Default or customised price-quality paths may not be reopened within a regulatory period on the grounds of a change in an input methodology, except as provided in subsection (2).\n    2. Every default and customised price-quality path must be reset by the Commission in accordance with section 53P if\u2014\n      a: an input methodology changes as a result of an appeal under section 52Z; and\n      b: had the changed methodology applied at the time the price-quality path was set, it would have resulted in a materially different path being set.\n    3. When resetting a default or customised price-quality path under subsection (2), the Commission must apply claw-back.\n    -- Notes --\n    Section 53ZB: inserted, on 14 October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n    -----------\n", "context": {"act_name": "Commerce Act 1986", "act_number": "5", "act_year": "1986", "schedule_label": null, "schedule_name": null, "part_label": "4", "part_name": "Regulated goods or services", "subpart_label": "6", "subpart_name": "Default/customised price-quality regulation", "crosshead_name": null, "section_label": null, "section_name": null, "paragraph_label": []}}, {"chunk_id": "Commerce Act 1986, Part 4, Subpart 7", "order": 4130, "text": "Subpart 7: Individual price-quality regulation\n  -- Notes --\n  Subpart 7: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n  -----------\n\n  53ZC: Price-quality path for individual businesses\n    1.

The requirements in respect of elections for the purposes of subsection (1)\ufeff(b) are as follows:\n      a: every trustee of the customer trust or community trust, or every member of the committee of shareholders of each customer co-operative, as the case may be, must have been elected solely by the persons who are consumers of the supplier; and\n      b: either\u2014\n        i: at least 90%\u00a0of the persons who are consumers of the supplier at the time of the election are eligible to vote in those elections; or\n        ii: in the case of a customer trust or community trust, there is ward-based voting that complies with the requirements of subsection (2B); and\n      c: each consumer must have an equal vote.\n    2B. The requirements for ward-based voting are as follows:\n      a: at least 90%\u00a0of the persons in a ward who are consumers of the supplier at the time of the election are eligible to vote in the election of all of the trustees of that ward; and\n      b: ward boundaries must provide for effective and fair representation of all consumers of the supplier, and in particular,\u2014\n        i: the proportion of consumers in relation to the number of trustees of the relevant trust must be approximately equal in each ward; and\n        ii: the wards must not be based on volume of electricity supplied; and\n      c: ward boundaries must be reviewed periodically (at intervals determined by the Commission) in consultation with all consumers of the supplier.\n    2C. A trustee of a customer trust or community trust, or a member of the committee of shareholders of a customer co-operative, as the case may be, must be treated as having been elected solely by the persons who are consumers of the supplier if the person\u2014\n      a: has been declared to be elected without an election in the case of a nominee at an election where the number of nominations was equal to or less than the number of vacancies; or\n      b: has been declared to be elected as the next-highest-polling candidate in the case where a higher-polling candidate at the election was unable to fill the elected position; or\n      c: has been declared to be elected by the remaining trustees or members following a casual vacancy that arose between elections, provided that\u2014\n        i: the person is the first person to have been so elected since the last election at which consumers of the supplier voted; and\n        ii: the person is elected to hold office only until the next scheduled election at which consumers of the supplier will vote.\n    2D. The Commerce Commission may require a supplier that claims to meet the criteria in this section to verify that claim by statutory declaration.\n    2E. The declaration must be made by the persons and in the form required by the Commerce Commission.\n    3. As soon as practicable after this subsection comes into force, the Minister must publish a notice in the Gazette stating the names of the suppliers that are consumer-owned as at that date.\n    4. The notice in subsection (3) is only for information purposes and has no legal effect.\n    -- Notes --\n    Section 54D: inserted, on 1\u00a0April 2009, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n    Section 54D(1)\ufeff(a): amended, on 1\u00a0November 2010, by section 151(1) of the Electricity Industry Act 2010 (2010 No\u00a0116).\n    Section 54D(1)\ufeff(b): substituted, on 1\u00a0November 2010, by section 151(2) of the Electricity Industry Act 2010 (2010 No\u00a0116).\n    Section 54D(2A): inserted, on 1\u00a0November 2010, by section 151(3) of the Electricity Industry Act 2010 (2010 No\u00a0116).\n    Section 54D(2B): inserted, on 1\u00a0November 2010, by section 151(3) of the Electricity Industry Act 2010 (2010 No\u00a0116).\n    Section 54D(2C): inserted, on 1\u00a0November 2010, by section 151(3) of the Electricity Industry Act 2010 (2010 No\u00a0116).\n    Section 54D(2D): inserted, on 1\u00a0November 2010, by section 151(3) of the Electricity Industry Act 2010 (2010 No\u00a0116).\n    Section 54D(2E): inserted, on 1\u00a0November 2010, by section 151(3) of the Electricity Industry Act 2010 (2010 No\u00a0116).\n    Section 54D(3): brought into force, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 2(1)\ufeff(b) of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n    -----------\n\n\n  # Imposition of regulation under this Part\n\n  -- Notes --\n  Heading: inserted, on 1\u00a0April 2009, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n  -----------\n\n  54E: Electricity lines services declared to be regulated\nElectricity lines services are regulated under this Part.\n    -- Notes --\n    Section 54E: inserted, on 1\u00a0April 2009, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n    -----------\n\n  54F: All electricity lines services are subject to information disclosure regulation\nAll electricity lines services are subject to information disclosure regulation under this Part.\n    -- Notes --\n    Section 54F: inserted, on 1\u00a0April 2009, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n    -----------\n\n  54G: Certain electricity lines services are also subject to default/customised price-quality regulation\n    1. All electricity lines services (other than those supplied by Transpower) are subject to default/customised price-quality regulation under this Part unless they are exempt.\n    2. All electricity lines services that are supplied by a supplier that is consumer-owned are exempt (unless an Order in Council has been made in respect of the service under section 54H).\n    -- Notes --\n    Section 54G: inserted, on 1\u00a0April 2009, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n    -----------\n\n  54H: How exempt status can be lost and default/customised price-quality regulation can be applied to consumer-owned suppliers\n    1. Electricity lines services that are supplied by a supplier that is consumer-owned cease to be exempt for the purpose of section 54G (and therefore become subject to default/customised price-quality regulation under this Part) if the Governor-General, by Order in Council, declares that this section applies.\n    2. The Minister may make a recommendation only if the Minister is satisfied that either\u2014\n      a: the Commission has advised the Minister that a supplier has ceased to be consumer-owned within the meaning of section 54D; or\n      b: the Commission has recommended to the Minister that the purpose of this Part would be better met if price-quality regulation were imposed on the supplier under this Part.\n    2A. A supplier must give notice in writing to the Commission within 10\u00a0working days after becoming aware that it has ceased to be consumer-owned.\n    3. The Commission may make a recommendation under subsection (2)\ufeff(b) only following consideration of a petition made by 1\u00a0or more of the following:\n      a: 15% of the persons who are domestic consumers of the supplier as at the date of the petition who are eligible to vote in elections for trustees of the customer trust or community trust, or for members of the committee of shareholders of the customer co-operative:\n      b: 20% of the persons who are domestic consumers of the supplier as at that date who are not eligible to vote in elections for trustees of the customer trust or community trust, or for members of the committee of shareholders of the customer co-operative:\n      c: 25% of the persons who are non-domestic consumers (either by number or by consumption of that class of consumer) of the supplier as at that date.\n    3A. In this section, domestic consumer has the same meaning as in section 5 of the Electricity Industry Act 2010.\n    4. If exact figures are not available as to the number of persons in a class referred to in subsection (3), the Commission may rely on any estimate that the Commission considers to be a reasonable estimate.\n    5. Petition means a petition to the Commission seeking the application of price-quality regulation to all or any of the electricity lines services of the relevant supplier, and that records the signatures of the signatories.\n    6. The Governor-General may, on the recommendation of the Minister, make an Order in Council in accordance with this section.\n    7.

The section 52P determinations that specify how information disclosure regulation applies to each supplier of electricity lines services must be made as soon as practicable after 1\u00a0April 2009.\n    2. The section 52P determinations that specify how default/customised price-quality regulation applies to each supplier of electricity lines services that is subject to that form of regulation as at 1\u00a0April 2009 are made as set out in section 54J.\n    3. The section 52P determinations that specify how default/customised price-quality regulation applies to each supplier of electricity lines services that becomes subject to that form of regulation as a result of an Order in Council made under section 54H must be made as soon as practicable after the order comes into force.\n    -- Notes --\n    Section 54I: inserted, on 1\u00a0April 2009, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n    -----------\n\n  54J: Section 52P determinations setting out default price-quality paths applying from 1\u00a0April 2009\n    1. This section applies in respect of suppliers of electricity lines services that are subject to default/customised price-quality regulation on and after 1\u00a0April 2009.\n    2. On and after 1\u00a0April 2009, the thresholds for large electricity lines businesses that expire on 31\u00a0March 2009 are deemed to be section 52P determinations that\u2014\n      a: apply those thresholds to each supplier as if the thresholds were default price-quality paths; and\n      b: state that the regulatory period for each supplier ends on 31\u00a0March 2010; and\n      c: comply with sections 52P and 53O; and\n      d: were notified in the Gazette under section 52P(7)\ufeff(b) at least 4\u00a0months before 1\u00a0April 2009.\n    3. However, a breach of a default price-quality path before the close of 31\u00a0March 2010 must be dealt with in accordance with section 54N and not under Part 6.\n    4. Nothing in this section affects sections 54N and 54O.\n    -- Notes --\n    Section 54J: inserted, on 1\u00a0April 2009, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n    -----------\n\n  54K: Section 52P determinations setting out default price-quality paths applying from 1\u00a0April 2010\n    1. Before 1\u00a0April 2010, the Commission must reset the default price-quality paths for each supplier that apply on and after that date, using the process set out in section 53P.\n    2. The Commission may reset the default price-quality paths even if all or any of the relevant input methodologies have not been determined.\n    3. If an input methodology is published after 1\u00a0April 2010 and if, had that methodology applied at the time the default price-quality paths were reset as required by subsection (1), it would have resulted in a materially different path being set, then the Commission may reset the default price-quality paths in accordance with section 53P and may apply claw-back, despite section 53ZB(1).\n    4. However, the Commission may not exercise its powers in subsection (3) later than 9\u00a0months after the date of publication of the input methodology.\n    5.

The enactment of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 does not limit or affect an administrative settlement to which this section applies, except as provided in this section.\n    3. Any breach of the administrative settlement must be dealt with in accordance with the terms of the settlement.\n    4. The expiry of the administrative settlement must be treated as if it were the end of a customised price-quality path, and section 53X applies accordingly (unless the supplier concerned would not otherwise be subject to default/customised price-quality regulation after the expiry of the settlement).\n    -- Notes --\n    Section 54L: inserted, on 1\u00a0April 2009, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n    -----------\n\n  54M: Administrative settlements with Transpower made before 1\u00a0April 2009\n    1. This section applies to any administrative settlement with Transpower that is accepted by the Commission before 1\u00a0April 2009 in respect of a breach of a threshold.\n    2. Any breach of an administrative settlement with Transpower may be dealt with under Part 6 as if it were a breach of a customised price-quality path, despite anything in the terms of the settlement.\n    3. Before the expiry of the administrative settlement, the Commission must recommend to the Minister that an Order in Council be made under section 52N declaring that either\u2014\n      a: Transpower is subject to default/customised price-quality regulation under subpart 6; or\n      b: Transpower is subject to individual price-quality regulation under subpart 7.\n    4. Subpart 2, except the provisions relating to inquiries, applies to the process for imposing that regulation and making the section 52P determination.\n    5. If an Order in Council declares that Transpower is subject to default/customised price-quality regulation, the section 52P determination must set the price-quality path that applies for the regulatory period commencing with the date on which the Order in Council comes into force, using the process under section 53P for resetting default price-quality paths.\n    6.     \n [repealed] \n    -- Notes --\n    Section 54M: inserted, on 1\u00a0April 2009, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n    Section 54M(3)\ufeff(b): amended, on 1\u00a0November 2010, by section 153(1) of the Electricity Industry Act 2010 (2010 No\u00a0116).\n    Section 54M(6): repealed, on 1\u00a0November 2010, by section 153(2) of the Electricity Industry Act 2010 (2010 No\u00a0116).\n    -----------\n\n  54N: Breaches of thresholds and default price-quality paths before 1\u00a0April 2010\n    1.

In this subpart, unless the context otherwise requires, gas pipeline services means the conveyance of natural gas by pipeline, including the assumption of responsibility for losses of natural gas.\n    2. However, none of the following are gas pipeline services:\n      a: conveying natural gas to a gas processing facility:\n      b: conveying natural gas if the total amount of gas conveyed to consumers by the supplier is less than 75\u00a0000\u00a0gigajoules per annum:\n      c: conveying natural gas by a pipeline that is listed in the second column of Schedule 6.\n    3.

The Commission must use the processes set out in section 53P in making the first section 52P determinations that set out how default price-quality regulation applies to suppliers of gas pipeline services as if 30\u00a0June 2010 were the end of the previous regulatory period.\n    2. However, if a supplier has increased its weighted average prices by more than the movement, or forecast movement, in the all groups index number of the Consumers Price Index in the period beginning 1\u00a0January 2008 and ending with the date that the determination is made, the Commission may apply claw-back to the extent of requiring the supplier to lower its prices in order to compensate consumers for some or all of any over-recovery of revenues that occurred during that period.\n    3. The Commission may set a default price-quality path in respect of suppliers of gas pipeline services even if all or any of the relevant input methodologies have not been determined.\n    4. If an input methodology is published after a section 52P determination referred to in subsection (1) is made, and if, had that methodology applied at the time the default price-quality paths were set as required by subsection (1), it would have resulted in a materially different path being set, then the Commission may reset the default price-quality paths and may apply claw-back, despite section 53ZB(1).\n    5. However, the Commission may not exercise its powers in subsection (4) later than 9\u00a0months after the date of publication of the input methodology.\n    -- Notes --\n    Section 55F: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n    Section 55F(2): amended, on 1\u00a0September 2022, by section 107(1) of the Data and Statistics Act 2022 (2022 No\u00a039).\n    -----------\n\n\n  # Services controlled by virtue of Commerce (Control of Natural Gas Services) Order 2005\n\n  -- Notes --\n  Heading: inserted, on 14\u00a0October 2008, by section 4 of the Commerce Amendment Act 2008 (2008 No\u00a070).\n  -----------\n\n  55G: Existing order, authorisations, and undertakings continue to apply until 1\u00a0July 2012 (or earlier expiry)\n    1.
